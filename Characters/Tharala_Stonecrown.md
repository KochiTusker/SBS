## Background

- **History:**
 - Tharala Stonecrown is the youngest child and only daughter of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown. Sister to Thrainor, Morgrin, and Khardek, she was raised in the shadow of their rivalries but quickly distinguished herself not through war, but through words. As of the present day, she is considered the last living child of Magra, her survival giving her unique weight in the fractured legacy of Manus Titanum.
 - Tharala was the family’s diplomat, renowned for her skill in negotiation and persuasion. She secured much of the empire’s trade wealth during Magra’s reign, drawing resources and alliances that fuelled both Ferrum Regnum and Caminus Primordialis. Where her brothers clashed with steel, she wielded influence with remarkable effectiveness. Her reputation as a negotiator was unmatched, able to turn enemies into trading partners and rivals into uneasy allies.
 - When the empire fractured, Tharala assumed rule of Caminus Primordialis, the cultural and diplomatic centre of dwarven civilisation. She sided with Thrainor during the succession crisis, supporting his claim as the rightful heir to Magra’s throne. Though unable to provide the same martial strength as Ferrum Regnum, Caminus became the gateway for foreign aid and soldiers, sustaining the war effort.

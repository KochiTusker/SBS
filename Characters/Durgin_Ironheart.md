## Background

- **History**
- Known as the Granite Vanguard, Durgin Ironheart was the founder of Manus Titanum and the progenitor of the Stonecrown line.
- He claimed descent from the fire giant Sulkarai, whose bloodline he believed granted him the strength to forge an empire. Once a paladin of Samvrit and a decorated Battle-Captain of Lex Veritas, he abandoned the honourable warfare of his order, declaring it futile against the barbarity of the goliaths.
- During the long stalemate between goliaths and Samvrit’s faithful, Durgin broke with tradition and began employing the very tactics of terror that had once plagued Caelovar. He ambushed caravans, led night raids on encampments, and slaughtered the children of goliath chieftains to end their bloodlines. These actions turned the tide of war, driving the goliaths from Caelovar and forcing them into exile across the sea. Yet his cruelty did not go unnoticed. The arch clerics of Iusticar condemned him for abandoning honour and mercy, and he was exiled from Lex Veritas, forbidden ever to return.
- Durgin carried his vision westward and in 1490 BCE founded Ferrum Regnum, the Iron Kingdom, carved into the Varranth Spine. From there, he launched invasions that toppled neighbouring realms, transforming his fledgling kingdom into the empire of Manus Titanum. His philosophy—that peace could only be won by confronting hardship and cruelty head-on—defined the empire for generations. Grand forges, fuelled by subjugated deep gnomes, were raised within the mountains, producing weapons that became the envy of the world.


- **Legacy**
- Durgin’s legacy is complex. To some, he is the saviour who freed Caelovar from the goliaths. To others, he is a butcher whose pragmatism birthed an empire built on blood. What is certain is that without him, neither the rise of Manus Titanum nor its eventual fall would have been possible.

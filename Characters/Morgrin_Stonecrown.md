## Background

- **History:**
 - Morgrin Stonecrown was the second son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, and one of the most gifted military leaders in dwarven history. Trained by his father, a celebrated general, Morgrin surpassed him early in his career, earning renown as a commander who led from the front. His strategies and relentless campaigns were instrumental in the expansion of Manus Titanum to its greatest territorial height.
 - When Magra died in 0 CE, Morgrin saw himself as the rightful heir to the throne. He believed the empire’s success was built on his campaigns and that this earned him—not his elder brother Thrainor—the crown. When Thrainor accused him of treason and attempted his arrest, Morgrin seized his inheritance in Caelum Ardens and declared secession. His sole aim was to reclaim the empire by force and reshape it under his vision of strength and dominance.
 - Morgrin was known for his brutality and his unwavering belief that might was the only true measure of worth. To his followers, he was a warrior-king who embodied dwarven resilience and ferocity. To his enemies, he was a tyrant whose ambition plunged the continent into the 100 Years War.
 - His rule in Caelum Ardens was marked by unrelenting aggression, supported by a culture that celebrated martial prowess above all else.
 - In 95 CE, Morgrin was killed on the battlefield, struck by an arrow to the eye while rallying his troops. His death left his only son, Tharnak Stonecrown, to carry on his legacy and lead Caelum Ardens in its war against Ferrum Regnum.

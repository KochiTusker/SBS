## Background

- **History**
 - Khardek Stonecrown was the third child and youngest son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, younger brother to Thrainor, Morgrin, and Tharala.
 - Among the siblings he was often regarded as the runt, overshadowed by the strength of his elder brothers and the charisma of his sister. Where Thrainor embodied law, Morgrin embodied strength, and Tharala diplomacy, Khardek struggled to find a role that was truly his own.
 - Though intelligent and sharp-minded, Khardek was a weak leader in the eyes of his family, and his decisions were often dismissed or overridden.
 - Khardek inherited Ferraria Tenebris, a city steeped in secrets, laboratories, and shadowy dealings. His rule was fragile, and when Morgrin’s rebellion began, Caelum Ardens swiftly annexed the city. After this, Khardek vanished from sight, rumoured to have retreated into the underground forges of Ferraria Tenebris, where experiments and hidden archives offered both refuge and danger.
 - To his siblings, Khardek was never more than a footnote in the struggle for power. Yet in the shadows, his intelligence and ambition may have found fertile ground, making him a figure whose legacy is defined less by open rule and more by whispers of what he might have become.

- **Motivations**
 - The dismissal of his pereceived worrth festered into bitterness. When Magra chose Thrainor as heir, Khardek’s resentment boiled over. He turned to poisons and shadows, lashing out at the family who had cast him aside. It was his hand that brought down Magra and Thrainor with mysterious illnesses, not to secure a throne but to deny them their legacies.
 - Retreating into Ferraria Tenebris, Khardek found kinship in secrecy and spite. He involved himself in the **Dustvale Accord**, where he bargained away fragments of Manus Titanum’s heritage for forbidden knowledge. Through this, he opened the way for **Drazkul Vurntash** to ferry warforged across the sea. Khardek saw only a chance to wound his siblings’ empire, not realising the greater consequences.
 - To him, the warforged were perfect weapons: silent, tireless, and like him, underestimated. He never grasped that their existence threatened the Wheel itself, nor that their resurgence played into the designs of powers beyond his control.
 - Khardek does not seek power for himself so much as the ruin of others. His actions are driven by envy and the deep wound of being forever overlooked. In his heart he believes that if he cannot rule, no one should.
 - He does not understand the full nature of the warforged or Daraksha’s designs. To him, they are simply the instruments of his spite — weapons to burn his family’s world. The cosmic consequences of his choices are beyond his imagining.

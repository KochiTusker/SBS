## Background
- **History**
 - Helgrid Stonecrown is the only daughter of Thrainor Stonecrown and granddaughter of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown. She inherited rule of Ferrum Regnum in 85 CE, following her father’s death from the same mysterious illness that claimed her grandmother. Young and untested, Helgrid was thrust into leadership at a time when her city was already exhausted by nearly a century of war.
 - Helgrid rules from the fortress-capital of Ferrum Regnum, once the heart of Manus Titanum but now a city scarred by siege and scarcity. She faces the dual burden of preserving her family’s legacy while ensuring her people’s survival against the unrelenting aggression of Caelum Ardens. -
 - Allies grow strained, resources dwindle, and her court is split between those who urge caution and those who demand bold retaliation.
 - Despite her youth, Helgrid is determined and pragmatic. She honours her father’s legacy of law and order, yet she cannot afford his rigidity; compromise and survival often take precedence over ideals. Her leadership has already been marked by efforts to maintain alliances with Caminus Primordialis and to secure aid from beyond dwarven lands, including mercenaries from Lex Veritas and arms from Novum Fabrica.
 - To her supporters, Helgrid is the beacon of hope for Ferrum Regnum, the last chance to reclaim dignity and endurance in the face of overwhelming odds. To her detractors, she is inexperienced, an unproven ruler thrust into a role too great for her. In truth, her reign is still being written, shaped by choices that may decide not only the fate of Ferrum Regnum but of the entire Shattered Empire

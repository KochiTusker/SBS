## Basic Information
- **Character Name:** Drazkul Vurntash
- **Character Alias:** 
- **Race:** Duegar
- **Era:** c. 376 BCE - Present
- **Place of Origin:** [Umbra Exilium](../Geography/Virelia/Umbra_Exilium.md)


## Background

- **History:**
 - Drazkul was once a duergar artificer armourer from the Eastern Isle, near [Umbra Exilium](../Geography/Virelia/Umbra_Exilium.md). When [Dominatus Rex](../Geography/Virelia/Dominatus_Rex.md) marched north and burned his homeland, he watched his country collapse, his pleas to trading partners unanswered. Among the invaders he saw soldiers clad in [Thalassan](../Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md)-forged armour, their insignia crudely scratched away. To Drazkul, this was proof of betrayal.
 - In desperation, he turned to the goddess [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md), who answered through her cult, the [Hollow Coin Syndicate](../Factions/Hollow_Coin_Syndicate.md). They stole blueprints for warforged directly from [Esochrein](../Patrons/Esochrein.md)’s vaults—an act thought impossible. In exchange, [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md) possessed Drazkul, binding his soul and twisting his will. From then on, he became her pawn, compelled to carry out her designs or face an unspeakable end.
 - Drazkul forged an army of warforged using the souls of refugees, captured prisoners and children, convincing himself he was saving them from death. He overthrew the duergar elders and led his machines against Dominatus Rex, winning at terrible cost—tens of thousands of lives bound into steel husks. Soon after, the Eastern Isle fell silent.
 - Now, Drazkul supplies Tharnak with warforged, though he intends one day to betray him. His true aim is revenge against Thalassa and, through Daraksha’s will, to plunge Caelovar into chaos, breaking every fragile alliance. He is not yet known to history; his name is a shadow, his existence erased. But the chaos spreading across Caelovar and Virelia is his legacy taking shape.

- **Further Details:**
 - The pact with [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md) has increased his lifespan. [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md) imbues him with enough life force to carry out her will. It is a curse on him.

- **Motivations**
 - He wants to save his people. He cannot bend the will of [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md) after making his pact with her. He does not know if his intentions to sow chaos in Caelovar are his own or [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md)'s. In his mind, he is constantly fighting her will and in glimpses sees the horrors that he has created. However, [Daraksha](../Deities/Daraksha.md)'s power largely overwhelms Drazkul making his moments of clarity fleeting.

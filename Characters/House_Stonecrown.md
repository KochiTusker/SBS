### Detailed Biographies

#### Durgin Ironheart

    - **Era:** c. 1500 BCE
    - **History**
     - Known as the Granite Vanguard, Durgin Ironheart was the founder of Manus Titanum and the progenitor of the Stonecrown line.
     - He claimed descent from the fire giant Sulkarai, whose bloodline he believed granted him the strength to forge an empire. Once a paladin of Samvrit and a decorated Battle-Captain of Lex Veritas, he abandoned the honourable warfare of his order, declaring it futile against the barbarity of the goliaths.
     - During the long stalemate between goliaths and Samvrit’s faithful, Durgin broke with tradition and began employing the very tactics of terror that had once plagued Caelovar. He ambushed caravans, led night raids on encampments, and slaughtered the children of goliath chieftains to end their bloodlines. These actions turned the tide of war, driving the goliaths from Caelovar and forcing them into exile across the sea. Yet his cruelty did not go unnoticed. The arch clerics of Iusticar condemned him for abandoning honour and mercy, and he was exiled from Lex Veritas, forbidden ever to return.
     - Durgin carried his vision westward and in 1490 BCE founded Ferrum Regnum, the Iron Kingdom, carved into the Varranth Spine. From there, he launched invasions that toppled neighbouring realms, transforming his fledgling kingdom into the empire of Manus Titanum. His philosophy—that peace could only be won by confronting hardship and cruelty head-on—defined the empire for generations. Grand forges, fuelled by subjugated deep gnomes, were raised within the mountains, producing weapons that became the envy of the world.
    - **Legacy**
     - Durgin’s legacy is complex. To some, he is the saviour who freed Caelovar from the goliaths. To others, he is a butcher whose pragmatism birthed an empire built on blood. What is certain is that without him, neither the rise of Manus Titanum nor its eventual fall would have been possible.

#### Magra Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 98 BCE - 0 CE
    - **Lineage:** Magra is around 20 generations descended from Durgin.
    - **History:**
     - Considered last emperor of Manus Titanum as empire split after her death. Magra Stonecrown, Empress of Manus Titanum, was a distant descendant of Durgin Ironheart and a further distant descendant of the fire giant Sulkarai. Her reign marked both the height of the dwarven empire and the seeds of its eventual collapse.
     - Raised as a warrior, Magra fought alongside her father during the empire’s expansion, proving herself a brilliant fighter who won tournaments with ease. Yet she was more than a soldier. She wrote poetry that circulated widely among the dwarves, and she cultivated an image of diplomacy and reason. Where Durgin had ruled through conquest and fear, Magra sought to temper the empire with culture and fairness. Lands she conquered were permitted semi-autonomous governance, and their people often lived peacefully under her oversight.
     - With her children, she cemented the empire’s dominance across the north. Yet in her later years, Magra turned her focus inward, training Thrainor to inherit her throne. She hoped to transform Manus Titanum from a war machine into a civilisation where the arts thrived and travellers were welcomed. She saw in Thrainor a steady ruler without lust for domination, unlike Morgrin, whose ambition unsettled her. This decision put her at odds with Thorgar, who favoured Morgrin as the stronger heir.
     - Magra’s final years were plagued by a mysterious illness that slowly drained her strength. When she died in 0 CE, the empire fractured. Her death divided her children: Thrainor claimed the imperial seat in Ferrum Regnum, Morgrin declared rebellion from Caelum Ardens, Khardek retreated into Ferraria Tenebris, and Tharala established rule in Caminus Primordialis. The resulting conflict ignited the 100 Years War, turning Magra’s legacy of diplomacy into a memory overshadowed by bloodshed.
    - **Legacy** To her people, Magra remains one of the most beloved rulers in dwarven history: a warrior-poet who sought to replace the iron fist of her ancestors with open hands, even as her death cast the empire into its darkest age.

#### Thorgar Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 115 BCE - Unknown
    - **History:**
     - Thorgar Stonecrown was the High Commander of the army of Manus Titanum and husband of the late Magra. A renowned strategist, he has personally trained all four of his children Thrainor, Morgrin, Khardek, and Tharala in the art of war. Following Magra's death, he publicly declared his support for Morgrin as the rightful heir to the empire.

#### Thrainor Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 40 BCE - 85 CE
    - **History**
     - Thrainor Stonecrown was the eldest son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, chosen by his mother as heir to the empire of Manus Titanum. From childhood he was trained for leadership, schooled not only in war but in the arts of governance and diplomacy. Magra believed Thrainor embodied her vision of a civilised empire, one tempered by law and culture rather than conquest. His father, Thorgar, disagreed, seeing Morgrin, the second son, as the stronger candidate.
     - When Magra died in 0 CE, Thrainor was declared emperor and assumed rule from Ferrum Regnum, the capital. His reign was immediately tested by conflict within his family. Determined to enforce his claim as Magra’s rightful heir, Thrainor moved against Morgrin, sending his personal guard to arrest him for treason. Instead of resolving the dispute, this act shattered the empire: Morgrin declared rebellion from Caelum Ardens, igniting the 100 Years War that still rages a century later.
     - Thrainor ruled Ferrum Regnum with unwavering adherence to law and authority, upholding his mother’s will as justification for his right to the throne. To some, he was a principled ruler, a man of order and conviction who sought to preserve the empire’s unity. To others, he was rigid and inflexible, unable to compromise even with his own kin.
     - His reign ended in 85 CE, when he succumbed to a mysterious illness strikingly similar to the condition that claimed his mother. His only daughter, Helgrid Stonecrown, inherited his position as ruler of Ferrum Regnum, continuing his struggle against Caelum Ardens

#### Morgrin Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 34 BCE - 95 CE
    - **History:**
     - Morgrin Stonecrown was the second son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, and one of the most gifted military leaders in dwarven history. Trained by his father, a celebrated general, Morgrin surpassed him early in his career, earning renown as a commander who led from the front. His strategies and relentless campaigns were instrumental in the expansion of Manus Titanum to its greatest territorial height.
     - When Magra died in 0 CE, Morgrin saw himself as the rightful heir to the throne. He believed the empire’s success was built on his campaigns and that this earned him—not his elder brother Thrainor—the crown. When Thrainor accused him of treason and attempted his arrest, Morgrin seized his inheritance in Caelum Ardens and declared secession. His sole aim was to reclaim the empire by force and reshape it under his vision of strength and dominance.
     - Morgrin was known for his brutality and his unwavering belief that might was the only true measure of worth. To his followers, he was a warrior-king who embodied dwarven resilience and ferocity. To his enemies, he was a tyrant whose ambition plunged the continent into the 100 Years War.
     - His rule in Caelum Ardens was marked by unrelenting aggression, supported by a culture that celebrated martial prowess above all else.
     - In 95 CE, Morgrin was killed on the battlefield, struck by an arrow to the eye while rallying his troops. His death left his only son, Tharnak Stonecrown, to carry on his legacy and lead Caelum Ardens in its war against Ferrum Regnum.

#### Khardek Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 25 BCE - Unknown
    - **History**
     - Khardek Stonecrown was the third child and youngest son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, younger brother to Thrainor, Morgrin, and Tharala.
     - Among the siblings he was often regarded as the runt, overshadowed by the strength of his elder brothers and the charisma of his sister. Where Thrainor embodied law, Morgrin embodied strength, and Tharala diplomacy, Khardek struggled to find a role that was truly his own.
     - Though intelligent and sharp-minded, Khardek was a weak leader in the eyes of his family, and his decisions were often dismissed or overridden.
     - Khardek inherited Ferraria Tenebris, a city steeped in secrets, laboratories, and shadowy dealings. His rule was fragile, and when Morgrin’s rebellion began, Caelum Ardens swiftly annexed the city. After this, Khardek vanished from sight, rumoured to have retreated into the underground forges of Ferraria Tenebris, where experiments and hidden archives offered both refuge and danger.
     - To his siblings, Khardek was never more than a footnote in the struggle for power. Yet in the shadows, his intelligence and ambition may have found fertile ground, making him a figure whose legacy is defined less by open rule and more by whispers of what he might have become.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>
    - **Motivations**
     - The dismissal of his pereceived worrth festered into bitterness. When Magra chose Thrainor as heir, Khardek’s resentment boiled over. He turned to poisons and shadows, lashing out at the family who had cast him aside. It was his hand that brought down Magra and Thrainor with mysterious illnesses, not to secure a throne but to deny them their legacies.
     - Retreating into Ferraria Tenebris, Khardek found kinship in secrecy and spite. He involved himself in the **Dustvale Accord**, where he bargained away fragments of Manus Titanum’s heritage for forbidden knowledge. Through this, he opened the way for **Drazkul Vurntash** to ferry warforged across the sea. Khardek saw only a chance to wound his siblings’ empire, not realising the greater consequences.
     - To him, the warforged were perfect weapons: silent, tireless, and like him, underestimated. He never grasped that their existence threatened the Wheel itself, nor that their resurgence played into the designs of powers beyond his control.
     - Khardek does not seek power for himself so much as the ruin of others. His actions are driven by envy and the deep wound of being forever overlooked. In his heart he believes that if he cannot rule, no one should.
     - He does not understand the full nature of the warforged or Daraksha’s designs. To him, they are simply the instruments of his spite — weapons to burn his family’s world. The cosmic consequences of his choices are beyond his imagining.

#### Tharala Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 20 BCE - Present
    - **History:**
     - Tharala Stonecrown is the youngest child and only daughter of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown. Sister to Thrainor, Morgrin, and Khardek, she was raised in the shadow of their rivalries but quickly distinguished herself not through war, but through words. As of the present day, she is considered the last living child of Magra, her survival giving her unique weight in the fractured legacy of Manus Titanum.
     - Tharala was the family’s diplomat, renowned for her skill in negotiation and persuasion. She secured much of the empire’s trade wealth during Magra’s reign, drawing resources and alliances that fuelled both Ferrum Regnum and Caminus Primordialis. Where her brothers clashed with steel, she wielded influence with remarkable effectiveness. Her reputation as a negotiator was unmatched, able to turn enemies into trading partners and rivals into uneasy allies.
     - When the empire fractured, Tharala assumed rule of Caminus Primordialis, the cultural and diplomatic centre of dwarven civilisation. She sided with Thrainor during the succession crisis, supporting his claim as the rightful heir to Magra’s throne. Though unable to provide the same martial strength as Ferrum Regnum, Caminus became the gateway for foreign aid and soldiers, sustaining the war effort.

#### Helgrid Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 60 CE - Present
    - **History**
     - Helgrid Stonecrown is the only daughter of Thrainor Stonecrown and granddaughter of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown. She inherited rule of Ferrum Regnum in 85 CE, following her father’s death from the same mysterious illness that claimed her grandmother. Young and untested, Helgrid was thrust into leadership at a time when her city was already exhausted by nearly a century of war.
     - Helgrid rules from the fortress-capital of Ferrum Regnum, once the heart of Manus Titanum but now a city scarred by siege and scarcity. She faces the dual burden of preserving her family’s legacy while ensuring her people’s survival against the unrelenting aggression of Caelum Ardens. -
     - Allies grow strained, resources dwindle, and her court is split between those who urge caution and those who demand bold retaliation.
     - Despite her youth, Helgrid is determined and pragmatic. She honours her father’s legacy of law and order, yet she cannot afford his rigidity; compromise and survival often take precedence over ideals. Her leadership has already been marked by efforts to maintain alliances with Caminus Primordialis and to secure aid from beyond dwarven lands, including mercenaries from Lex Veritas and arms from Novum Fabrica.
     - To her supporters, Helgrid is the beacon of hope for Ferrum Regnum, the last chance to reclaim dignity and endurance in the face of overwhelming odds. To her detractors, she is inexperienced, an unproven ruler thrust into a role too great for her. In truth, her reign is still being written, shaped by choices that may decide not only the fate of Ferrum Regnum but of the entire Shattered Empire

#### Tharnak Stonecrown
    - **Era:** 50 CE - Present
    - **History:**
     - Tharnak Stonecrown is the young king of Caelum Ardens, thrust into leadership earlier than anticipated after his father Morgrin's death in the 100 years war.
     - Tharnak is hell bent on continuing his father's legacy and re-conquering what he believes is owed to his father, driven by a sense of inherited obligation and unfinished business from the prior generation.
     - He was trained virtually since birth to be his father's second in command, groomed for a supporting role rather than immediate rule. His father's death during the 100 years war forced him to assume the throne at a young age, cutting short his intended preparation period.
<details><summary>Secret</summary>
    - **Motivations:**
     - Tharnak feels like he lives in the shadow of his father. He wants to be a great leader but is inexperienced and is very hesitant, paralysed by the need to get thing right. Tharnak secretly hates what Morgrin stood for but feels trapped into enacting his vision because it’s the only way to hold Caelum Ardens together. When Khardek came out of hiding, he sought to manipulate Tharnak. Tharnak secretly knows Khardek tries to manipulate him but leans on him while he tries to find his own footing as a leader

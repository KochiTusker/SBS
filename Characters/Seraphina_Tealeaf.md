- **Character Alias:** 
- **Race:** High Elf
- **Era:** c. 478 BCE - Present
- **Place of Origin:** Thalassa


## Background

- **History:**
 - Seraphina Tealeaf, High Elf Queen of Thalassa, has ruled Porta Fortuna for more than six centuries. She is one of the longest-reigning monarchs in Caelovar, old enough to see much of the expansion of Manus Titanum. She endured personal tragedy when her consort, Prince Vaelion, was slain at sea by raiders from Caelum Ardens during the early decades of the 100 Years War.
 - Seraphina lived through the Great Silence of Virelia, a formative event that impressed upon her the fragility of wealth and trade. She ascended the throne of Thalassa five centuries ago, inheriting a modest kingdom and transforming it into the beating heart of global commerce. Under her reign, Porta Fortuna’s harbour was fortified, its navy expanded, and Thalassan merchants reached every corner of Caelovar.
 - Though struck by grief, she declared Thalassa neutral in the wars of her age, positioning the realm as a broker between warring states. This pragmatism ensured Thalassa grew rich while others bled. To her people she is both admired as the architect of their prosperity and feared as a ruler whose heart seems bound more to ledgers and treaties than to kin.
 - Relations: Spouse of Vaelion (consort, slain by Caelum Ardens raiders). Great Grandmother of Kaelen (prince of Thalassa, prepared heir to the throne).
 
- **Further Details:**
 - Seraphina had 3 children and 5 grandchildren. Seraphina was very particular about who she wanted to be her heir and there were questions from the public on why she chose her Great Grandson Kaelen over her children and grandchildren. It caused quite a bit of family tension with some of her children leaving the country.

- **Motivations**
  - She is very protective of her secret and behind the scenes it causes her quite a lot of paranoia. However, she wants to use Serpent & Ember to secretly undermine and control other countries without it being known that she is behind the scenes. Serpent & Ember might sell arms to the enemies of Thalassa's allies to ensure a war rages longer than it should. She may use Serpent & Ember to blackmail people she sees as competition or threats. In her mind, she is just doing what is best for Thalassa and trying to get around global politics by hiding away her more devious actions. A small part of her knows that what she is doing is wrong and unethical, but she believes that it helps keep rival nations less powerful.
  - She felt threatened by Pactum Vesperae's growing rivalry with Thalassa. While they had not reached the level of power of Thalassa, Seraphina felt it posed a threat to Thalassa. She secretly supplied arms to Dominatus Rex in their fight against Pactum Vesperae. However, she made sure that it could not be tied back to Thalassa so she instructed her smugglers to remove all markings that could tie the arms to Thalassa.
  - She knows about the mining operation in The Badlands though Serpent & Ember. She knows that there are people in the Hollow Coin Syndicate that buy the rare metals from the mines but she doesn't know what the metals are used for and why it gets such a high price.
  - Her greatest deception endures in the shadows of her own harbours. She is the Serpent of Serpent & Ember — a queen who bartered her crown’s purity to keep her realm fed and her rivals blind. The Syndicate is both her sin and her surviva

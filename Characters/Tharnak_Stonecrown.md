 - Tharnak Stonecrown is the young king of Caelum Ardens, thrust into leadership earlier than anticipated after his father Morgrin's death in the 100 years war.
 - Tharnak is hell bent on continuing his father's legacy and re-conquering what he believes is owed to his father, driven by a sense of inherited obligation and unfinished business from the prior generation.
 - He was trained virtually since birth to be his father's second in command, groomed for a supporting role rather than immediate rule. His father's death during the 100 years war forced him to assume the throne at a young age, cutting short his intended preparation period.

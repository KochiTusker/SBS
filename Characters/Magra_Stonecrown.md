## Background

- **Lineage:** Magra is around 20 generations descended from Durgin Ironheart.
- **History:**
 - Considered last emperor of Manus Titanum as empire split after her death. Magra Stonecrown, Empress of Manus Titanum, was a distant descendant of Durgin Ironheart and a further distant descendant of the fire giant Sulkarai. Her reign marked both the height of the dwarven empire and the seeds of its eventual collapse.
 - Raised as a warrior, Magra fought alongside her father during the empire’s expansion, proving herself a brilliant fighter who won tournaments with ease. Yet she was more than a soldier. She wrote poetry that circulated widely among the dwarves, and she cultivated an image of diplomacy and reason. Where Durgin had ruled through conquest and fear, Magra sought to temper the empire with culture and fairness. Lands she conquered were permitted semi-autonomous governance, and their people often lived peacefully under her oversight.
 - With her children, she cemented the empire’s dominance across the north. Yet in her later years, Magra turned her focus inward, training Thrainor to inherit her throne. She hoped to transform Manus Titanum from a war machine into a civilisation where the arts thrived and travellers were welcomed. She saw in Thrainor a steady ruler without lust for domination, unlike Morgrin, whose ambition unsettled her. This decision put her at odds with Thorgar, who favoured Morgrin as the stronger heir.
 - Magra’s final years were plagued by a mysterious illness that slowly drained her strength. When she died in 0 CE, the empire fractured. Her death divided her children: Thrainor claimed the imperial seat in Ferrum Regnum, Morgrin declared rebellion from Caelum Ardens, Khardek retreated into Ferraria Tenebris, and Tharala established rule in Caminus Primordialis. The resulting conflict ignited the 100 Years War, turning Magra’s legacy of diplomacy into a memory overshadowed by bloodshed.

- **Legacy** To her people, Magra remains one of the most beloved rulers in dwarven history: a warrior-poet who sought to replace the iron fist of her ancestors with open hands, even as her death cast the empire into its darkest age.

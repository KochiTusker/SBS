### Ozrik Vale
    - **Era:** 120 BCE - Present
    - **History**
     - Ozrik Vale is a dwarf artificer whose lineage traces back to Manus Titanum. Towards the end of the reign of Empress Magra, he distinguished himself by developing cutting edge magical armour although it found its way onto the battlefield.
     - The outbreak of the 100 Years War displaced Ozrik, and he fled to Ordo Sapientium seeking refuge. There, he became disillusioned by the Council’s strict neutrality, especially in the 100 Years War, and the marginalisation of the Inarcanus. His protests against these policies led to imprisonment, though he served only two years before being freed by fellow dissenters.
     - Within Ordo Sapientium, Ozrik came to believe that those without magic — the Inarcanus — were condemned to second-class citizenship in a society ruled by spell and lineage. His call for equality through invention was not rebellion in name but revolution in fact: to him, the forge and the loom were the truest forms of magic, accessible to all.
     - Twenty years ago, Ozrik led the secession of Cindralux, declaring it the capital of Novum Fabrica, a new republic founded as a haven for Inarcanus and innovators. He was elected its first president and has retained the office across four terms, becoming both the political and symbolic leader of the young nation.

    - **Motivations**
      - As Ozrik's new republic took form in Novum Fabrica, he found that liberty without order was chaos. He accepted power not out of greed, but conviction that only his hand could hold the balance — a belief that would make him both savior and sovereign

### Seraphina Tealeaf
    - **Era:** 478 BCE - Present
    - **History:**
     - Seraphina Tealeaf, High Elf Queen of Thalassa, has ruled Porta Fortuna for more than six centuries. She is one of the longest-reigning monarchs in Caelovar, old enough to see much of the expansion of Manus Titanum. She endured personal tragedy when her consort, Prince Vaelion, was slain at sea by raiders from Caelum Ardens during the early decades of the 100 Years War.
     - Seraphina lived through the Great Silence of Virelia, a formative event that impressed upon her the fragility of wealth and trade. She ascended the throne of Thalassa five centuries ago, inheriting a modest kingdom and transforming it into the beating heart of global commerce. Under her reign, Porta Fortuna’s harbour was fortified, its navy expanded, and Thalassan merchants reached every corner of Caelovar.
     - Though struck by grief, she declared Thalassa neutral in the wars of her age, positioning the realm as a broker between warring states. This pragmatism ensured Thalassa grew rich while others bled. To her people she is both admired as the architect of their prosperity and feared as a ruler whose heart seems bound more to ledgers and treaties than to kin.
     - Relations: Spouse of Vaelion (consort, slain by Caelum Ardens raiders). Great Grandmother of Kaelen (prince of Thalassa, prepared heir to the throne).
    - **Further Details:**
     - Seraphina had 3 children and 5 grandchildren. Seraphina was very particular about who she wanted to be her heir and there were questions from the public on why she chose her Great Grandson Kaelen over her children and grandchildren. It caused quite a bit of family tension with some of her children leaving the country.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>
    - **Motivations**
     - She is very protective of her secret and behind the scenes it causes her quite a lot of paranoia. However, she wants to use Serpent & Ember to secretly undermine and control other countries without it being known that she is behind the scenes. Serpent & Ember might sell arms to the enemies of Thalassa's allies to ensure a war rages longer than it should. She may use Serpent & Ember to blackmail people she sees as competition or threats. In her mind, she is just doing what is best for Thalassa and trying to get around global politics by hiding away her more devious actions. A small part of her knows that what she is doing is wrong and unethical, but she believes that it helps keep rival nations less powerful.
     - She felt threatened by Pactum Vesperae's growing rivalry with Thalassa. While they had not reached the level of power of Thalassa, Seraphina felt it posed a threat to Thalassa. She secretly supplied arms to Dominatus Rex in their fight against Pactum Vesperae. However, she made sure that it could not be tied back to Thalassa so she instructed her smugglers to remove all markings that could tie the arms to Thalassa.
     - She knows about the mining operation in The Badlands though Serpent & Ember. She knows that there are people in the Hollow Coin Syndicate that buy the rare metals from the mines but she doesn't know what the metals are used for and why it gets such a high price.
     - Her greatest deception endures in the shadows of her own harbours. She is the Serpent of Serpent & Ember — a queen who bartered her crown’s purity to keep her realm fed and her rivals blind. The Syndicate is both her sin and her surviva

### Fimble Bronzebolt
    - **Era:** c. 350 BCE - Present
    - **History:**
     - Fimble Bronzebolt is a gnomish artificer known throughout Cindralux. Her name is often spoken in the city’s markets and taverns, where she sells ingenious contraptions to common folk like: lamps that never go out, kettles that boil themselves, locks that open with a whispered word. To some she is harmlessly eccentric, to others, a visionary tinkerer who makes magic accessible. Her workshop has become a beacon for those seeking clever tools at fair prices.
     - Born in Virelia, Fimble lost her kin during the goliath invasions and fled with nothing but her life. She was taken in by Ordo Sapientium, where she first believed she had found safety, but the Council’s treatment of Inarcanus embittered her. Rumours claim she also blames Lex Veritas for driving the goliaths to the shores of Virelia, which she never forgave.
     - When Novum Fabrica declared independence, she was among the first to secede, bringing her craft and her mistrust of authority to Cindralux.
     - Fimble is known for her sharp tongue, her open disdain for governments that betray their people, and her independence. Whispers suggest her skills may have attracted the attention of groups with far-reaching ambitions, though such claims remain unproven.
    - **Further Details:**

<details><summary>Secret</summary>
    - **Motivations**
     - Fimble is driven by the memory of betrayal—first by the destruction of her homeland, then by Ordo Sapientium’s dismissal of Inarcanus. Her inventions are not merely for comfort or trade; she believes technology should empower the common folk against corrupt powers.
     - Some say she has already supplied hidden groups—perhaps even Serpent & Ember with devices that give them an edge in smuggling or sabotage. Whether knowingly or not, her tools may already be shaping conflicts across Caelovar.

### Drazkul Vurntash
    - **Era:** c. 376 BCE - Present
    - **History:**
     - Drazkul was once a duergar artificer armourer from the Eastern Isle, near Umbra Exilium. When Dominatus Rex marched north and burned his homeland, he watched his country collapse, his pleas to trading partners unanswered. Among the invaders he saw soldiers clad in Thalassan-forged armour, their insignia crudely scratched away. To Drazkul, this was proof of betrayal.
     - In desperation, he turned to the goddess Daraksha, who answered through her cult, the Hollow Coin Syndicate. They stole blueprints for warforged directly from Esochrein’s vaults—an act thought impossible. In exchange, Daraksha possessed Drazkul, binding his soul and twisting his will. From then on, he became her pawn, compelled to carry out her designs or face an unspeakable end.
     - Drazkul forged an army of warforged using the souls of refugees, captured prisoners and children, convincing himself he was saving them from death. He overthrew the duergar elders and led his machines against Dominatus Rex, winning at terrible cost—tens of thousands of lives bound into steel husks. Soon after, the Eastern Isle fell silent.
     - Now, Drazkul supplies Tharnak with warforged, though he intends one day to betray him. His true aim is revenge against Thalassa and, through Daraksha’s will, to plunge Caelovar into chaos, breaking every fragile alliance. He is not yet known to history; his name is a shadow, his existence erased. But the chaos spreading across Caelovar and Virelia is his legacy taking shape.
    - **Further Details:**
     - The pact with Daraksha has increased his lifespan. Daraksha imbues him with enough life force to carry out her will. It is a curse on him.
    - **Motivations**
     - He wants to save his people. He cannot bend the will of Daraksha after making his pact with her. He does not know if his intentions to sow chaos in Caelovar are his own or Daraksha's. In his mind, he is constantly fighting her will and in glimpses sees the horrors that he has created. However, Daraksha's power largely overwhelms Drazkul making his moments of clarity fleeting.

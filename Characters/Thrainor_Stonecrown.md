## Background

- **History**
 - Thrainor Stonecrown was the eldest son of Magra and Thorgar Stonecrown, chosen by his mother as heir to the empire of Manus Titanum. From childhood he was trained for leadership, schooled not only in war but in the arts of governance and diplomacy. Magra believed Thrainor embodied her vision of a civilised empire, one tempered by law and culture rather than conquest. His father, Thorgar, disagreed, seeing Morgrin, the second son, as the stronger candidate.
 - When Magra died in 0 CE, Thrainor was declared emperor and assumed rule from Ferrum Regnum, the capital. His reign was immediately tested by conflict within his family. Determined to enforce his claim as Magra’s rightful heir, Thrainor moved against Morgrin, sending his personal guard to arrest him for treason. Instead of resolving the dispute, this act shattered the empire: Morgrin declared rebellion from Caelum Ardens, igniting the 100 Years War that still rages a century later.
 - Thrainor ruled Ferrum Regnum with unwavering adherence to law and authority, upholding his mother’s will as justification for his right to the throne. To some, he was a principled ruler, a man of order and conviction who sought to preserve the empire’s unity. To others, he was rigid and inflexible, unable to compromise even with his own kin.
 - His reign ended in 85 CE, when he succumbed to a mysterious illness strikingly similar to the condition that claimed his mother. His only daughter, Helgrid Stonecrown, inherited his position as ruler of Ferrum Regnum, continuing his struggle against Caelum Ardens

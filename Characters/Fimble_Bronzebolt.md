## Background

- **History:**
  - Fimble Bronzebolt is a gnomish artificer known throughout Cindralux. Her name is often spoken in the city’s markets and taverns, where she sells ingenious contraptions to common folk like: lamps that never go out, kettles that boil themselves, locks that open with a whispered word. To some she is harmlessly eccentric, to others, a visionary tinkerer who makes magic accessible. Her workshop has become a beacon for those seeking clever tools at fair prices.
  - Born in Virelia, Fimble lost her kin during the goliath invasions and fled with nothing but her life. She was taken in by Ordo Sapientium, where she first believed she had found safety, but the Council’s treatment of Inarcanus embittered her. Rumours claim she also blames Lex Veritas for driving the goliaths to the shores of Virelia, which she never forgave.
  - When Novum Fabrica declared independence, she was among the first to secede, bringing her craft and her mistrust of authority to Cindralux.
  - Fimble is known for her sharp tongue, her open disdain for governments that betray their people, and her independence. Whispers suggest her skills may have attracted the attention of groups with far-reaching ambitions, though such claims remain unproven.

    - **Motivations**
     - Fimble is driven by the memory of betrayal—first by the destruction of her homeland, then by Ordo Sapientium’s dismissal of Inarcanus. Her inventions are not merely for comfort or trade; she believes technology should empower the common folk against corrupt powers.
     - Some say she has already supplied hidden groups—perhaps even Serpent & Ember with devices that give them an edge in smuggling or sabotage. Whether knowingly or not, her tools may already be shaping conflicts across Caelovar.

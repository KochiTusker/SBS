## Basic Information
- **Character Name:** Fimble Bronzebolt

- **Era:** c. 350 BCE - Present
- **Place of Origin:** [The Badlands](../Geography/Caelovar/Badlands.md)

## Background

- **History:**
  - Fimble Bronzebolt is a deep gnome artisan, known across [Thalassa](../Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md)’s dockside markets as both a genius inventor and a relentless moral critic. Once an apprentice of [Ordo Sapientium](../Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md)’s mechanical ateliers, she turned her back on institutional authority after witnessing the subjugation of her people under [Manus Titanum](../Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md)’s industrial regimes. To Fimble, every great power — divine, political, or academic — eventually becomes a machine built to grind the small into dust.
  - She fled the mainland after the independence wars and settled in [Thalassa](../Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md), a city she distrusts but cannot resist. Here, she operates a workshop called The Balanced Gear, where she builds intricate devices and sells them at fair prices, funding homes, clinics, and safe havens for disenfranchised gnomes and refugees. To the public, she’s a paragon of integrity: sharp-tongued, incorruptible, and uncompromising.

- **Motivations**
 - Privately, her conscience is less clean. Much of her philanthropy is financed through lucrative commissions from the Sildore Exchange, who employ her designs in the [Badlands](../Geography/Caelovar/Badlands.md) mines. Fimble suspects her inventions — energy regulators, tunneling augments, and “safety” automatons — serve darker purposes, perhaps even linked to the Dirge Core trade. She tells herself it’s harmless, that her inventions save lives. But the coin keeps flowing, and she’s learned not to ask questions.
 - In conversation, Fimble is quick to condemn hypocrisy — and slower to see her own. She rails against Ferrum Regnum’s tyranny, [Ordo Sapientium](../Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md)’s elitism, and the long unbroken rule of Ozrik Vale. Yet the same moral fire that fuels her hatred burns inward, eating at her certainty. She is at once a savior and an accomplice, an idealist buying virtue with tainted gold.
 - Fimble’s philanthropy began as an act of rebellion against her homeland’s exploitation, but over the years, guilt and pragmatism have blurred her purpose. She cannot admit to herself that she’s become part of the very system she despises.
 - Narrative Function: Fimble serves as a moral mirror for the party — a test of integrity in a world where everyone’s hands are dirty. Whether she is redeemed, exposed, or destroyed depends entirely on who dares to confront her contradictions.
 - Rumors: Some claim she’s quietly sabotaging the Sildore Exchange’s supply chain; others whisper that she’s designing something new — a device that could unmake the mines themselves.

## Background

- **History**
  - Ozrik Vale is a dwarf artificer whose lineage traces back to [Manus Titanum](../Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md)
. Towards the end of the reign of [Empress Magra](./Magra_Stonecrown.md), he distinguished himself by developing cutting edge magical armour although it found its way onto the battlefield.
  - The outbreak of the 100 Years War displaced Ozrik, and he fled to [Ordo Sapientium](../Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md) seeking refuge. There, he became disillusioned by the Council’s strict neutrality, especially in the [100 Years War](../World_Overview.md), and the marginalisation of the Inarcanus. His protests against these policies led to imprisonment, though he served only two years before being freed by fellow dissenters.
  - Within Ordo Sapientium, Ozrik came to believe that those without magic — the [Inarcanus](../Glossary.md) — were condemned to second-class citizenship in a society ruled by spell and lineage. His call for equality through invention was not rebellion in name but revolution in fact: to him, the forge and the loom were the truest forms of magic, accessible to all.
  - Twenty years ago, Ozrik led the secession of Cindralux, declaring it the capital of [Novum Fabrica](../Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md), a new republic founded as a haven for Inarcanus and innovators. He was elected its first president and has retained the office across four terms, becoming both the political and symbolic leader of the young nation.

  - **Motivations**
    - As Ozrik's new republic took form in [Novum Fabrica](../Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md), he found that liberty without order was chaos. He accepted power not out of greed, but conviction that only his hand could hold the balance — a belief that would make him both savior and sovereign

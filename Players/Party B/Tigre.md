### Roleplay Questions



### Upbringing

Tigre was born into a normal family. His father died when he was 12 years old. Since then, he has had to do odd jobs to support his family.

Brody Streets used to work with Tigre in the Caelovar Championship Wrestling (CCW) League. They were both B list wrestlers and travelled around doing shows. However, they felt they could be frontrunners and wanted better pay. They decided to try to unionise with other wrestlers in the league leading them to be snitched on by the star A list wrestler Bulk Bogan. The wrestling company was owned by a man called Vance F. McAnus.

Brody and Tigre set up their own wrestling promotion (with the other ousted wrestlers) to compete with CCW but to limited success. They pivoted to become a travelling wrestling promotion (akin to a circus). Through a lack of consistent income and lack of popularity of Pro-Wrestling in other kingdoms they have resorted to marketing themselves as a Fighting Troupe where they took bets on â€˜fixedâ€™ matches. They have become wildly successful but have invoked the ire of many who have seen through their scam.

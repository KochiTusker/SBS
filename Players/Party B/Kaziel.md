### Roleplay Questions


### Upbringing
**Azaroth** and **Kaziel** are twins. They were from a loving family of high noble standing. Lovers of art and skilled practitioners of magic, their parents love **Kaziel**, **Azaroth**, and their sister Cereza. 
But **Kaziel** has never enjoyed conforming to the familyâ€™s image. Long-sleeve dress shirts, expressing themselves through frames on the wall instead of the clothes they wear. Not to mention, his abilities tend much more towards the physical than the magical. 
Azarothâ€™s talent combined with a parental fear of Kaz falling behind led their parents to send them to the Caminus Royal Academy, one of the most respected multi-domain schools in Caelovar.
**Azaroth** was there with the intent of perfecting his abilities and Kaz was just trying to find his. **Kaziel** did not take his studies seriously, skirting by and slacking off while **Azaroth** was the star student at the school, who isolated himself to excel in his studies to impress his family. 
**Kaziel** was soon realising his antics were potentially quite costly, and as his luck was looking to run out, he made yet another unlikely friend. 
Professor Draunt, a well-respected scholarly teacher at the school, came to him and offered some personal tutelage, and maybe even answers to some upcoming tests. **Kaziel**, suspecting nothing, of course accepted, believing himself to have found a golden ticket. Draunt however, had ulterior motives. 
In the months that followed, Draunt placed **Kaziel** under a subtle and gradual spell, manipulating him in both body and mind. Through both words and magic, Draunt brought **Kaziel** to a state of total trust, before taking the changes further. In private, Draunt took **Kaziel** from a simple student to a large, muscular, barely-thinking beast. The change didnâ€™t hold, but **Kaziel** was still changed. Now with red skin and horns, he thought little of it. But his brother was definitely not the same. 
That very night, **Azaroth** escaped the school with **Kaziel**, hoping to minimise the number of people who saw him like this, desperate to maintain his familyâ€™s image. There in search of someone who can cure **Kaziel**â€™s condition, **Azaroth** has lied and told **Kaziel** they are there for an award ceremony, with the promise of a lot of free food and flirty figures.



### Motivation
Currently, **Azaroth** is attempting to fix his brothers situation to save face for the family. He is unaware of Professor Draunt's attempt to make **Kaziel** into a demonic idol. He wants to achieve some semblance of stability with his brother, and he will do anything to keep up appearances for the family. 
**Azaroth** has convinced his brother to go to Porta Fortuna to accept an award on behalf of his family and to attend a lavish event with free food & drink. This was a lie to get **Kaziel** to see a famous cleric of Daraksha called, **Brugo** , who claims to be able to heal anyone (but can he?).

### Enemies

Professor Draunt. **Azaroth** heavily disliked Professor Draught and his grooming of **Kaziel**. The night **Kaziel** came back from his dorm in his new form, **Azaroth** immediately took him from the academy in search of a way to fix him.

### Family
- Cereza, 13 - Sister. Spoilt and deadpan, a bit bratty. Fully trusting of her brothersâ€™ abilities
- Vincent, 65 - Father. Kind and soft-spoken but values discipline and expression
- Selma, 59 - Mother. Loud and rambunctious. Encourages expression through art
- Zevra, 45 - Aunt. Animal hunter collecting pelts. Black sheep of the family. **Azaroth** is intimidated by her and finds things awkward
- **Azaroth** - Twin brother who is also a member of the party


### Attachments
- Butler Harris, 75 - Elderly dwarf butler. Supported Sangars for 25 years. **Azaroth** fond of him. Taught him how to shoot a bow & arrow. Mentored him through expectations and running the family business
- Professor Kyra, 245 - Middle aged elf teacher at the Caminus Royal Academy. Pushed **Azaroth** to greater lengths. Helped **Azaroth** develop his revolver prototype and develop the finger guns spell. Instrumental to Azarothâ€™s development



### Vices

- Kaz is a punk who rejects conformity.
- He is almost too trusting of anyone.
- Academia bores him

### Secrets

Draunt saga is a closely guarded secret. Most of Kaziel's secrets are kept from his family. How he really likes to present himself, his friends, his crushes, he tries to hide it from his brother and parents as best he can. His most recent secret, kept from his brother, is that he secretly likes his new demonic appearance. Red skin and horns, it suits him. This is even independent of Draunt's manipulations. But obviously he can't let his brother know he likes the changes.

### Upbringing
**Azaroth** and **Kaziel** are twins. They were from a loving family of high noble standing. Lovers of art and skilled practitioners of magic, their parents love **Kaziel**, **Azaroth**, and their sister Cereza. 
Azarothâ€™s most cherished memories are **Kaziel** protecting Az from bullies when they were 8. He also has fond memories of reading in the gardens of the estate. Az would primarily read and learn about the fascinating world of magic and science. 
Azarothâ€™s talent combined with a parental fear of **Kaz** falling behind led their parents to send them to the Caminus Royal Academy, one of the most respected multi-domain schools in Caelovar.
**Azaroth** was there with the intent of perfecting his abilities. Azaroth was the star student at the school, who isolated himself to excel in his studies to impress his family. 
Professor Draunt, a well-respected scholarly teacher at the school, came to Azaroth's brother **Kaziel** him and offered some personal tutelage, and maybe even answers to some upcoming tests. **Kaziel**, suspecting nothing, of course accepted, believing himself to have found a golden ticket. Draunt however, had ulterior motives. 
In the months that followed, Draunt placed **Kaziel** under a subtle and gradual spell, manipulating him in both body and mind. Through both words and magic, Draunt brought **Kaziel** to a state of total trust, before taking the changes further. In private, Draunt took **Kaziel** from a simple student to a large, muscular, barely-thinking beast. The change didnâ€™t hold, but **Kaziel** was still changed. Now with red skin and horns, he thought little of it. But his brother was definitely not the same. 
That very night, **Azaroth** escaped the school with **Kaziel**, hoping to minimise the number of people who saw him like this, desperate to maintain his familyâ€™s image. There in search of someone who can cure Kazielâ€™s condition, **Azaroth** has lied and told **Kaziel** they are there for an award ceremony, with the promise of a lot of free food and flirty figures.
**Azaroth** heavily disliked Professor Draught and his grooming of **Kaziel**. The night **Kaziel** came back from his dorm in his new form, **Azaroth** immediately took him from the academy in search of a way to fix him.


### Motivation
Currently, **Azaroth** is attempting to fix his brothers situation to save face for the family. He is unaware of Professor Draunt's attempt to make **Kaziel** into a demonic idol. He wants to achieve some semblance of stability with his brother, and he will do anything to keep up appearances for the family. 
**Azaroth** has convinced his brother to go to Porta Fortuna to accept an award on behalf of his family and to attend a lavish event with free food & drink. This was a lie to get **Kaziel** to see a famous cleric of Daraksha called, **Brugo** , who claims to be able to heal anyone (but can he?).

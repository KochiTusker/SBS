### Roleplay Questions


### Upbringing

Meredith is a robin familiar of Brugo's and has grown up with him since a young age. She is a very chaotic little bird who constantly talks smack.

Brugo has been indoctrinated since birth into following the path of discord and chaos through living with his mother near Lex Veritas. His mother is part of the cult of Daraksha and a cleric of her's although not many know her links to Daraksha. Though unlike his many siblings mother he never seemed to have an initial love for chaos. While his family made chaos intentionally Brugo was always attempting to preach the word of Daraksha with kindness and love; which always somehow ended up with the most chaotic outcomes possible.

As a child he went to the temple of Daraksha and prayed for guidance but heard nothing, before leaving however he heard a whisper of a voice â€œi cannot be there to guide you, for Chaos cannot be taught, but she is my will, she will exert my discord through your voiceâ€, at which point a tiny Robin appeared and said "What the FUCK am i doing here? Who are you NUMBNUTS? Liten here you little SHIT! I gots 1 goal in life and it's to make sure you don't become a saggy arsed loser!...i mean...Kaa kaa I'm a bird...or whatever"

After years of torment through pranks and tricks Brugo was barely clinging to sanity; when eventually his parents took it too far and removed one of Brugoâ€™s kidneys as a joke to appease Daraksha. At this point he left his home.


### Motivation

Brugo and Meredith have been travelling for some time spreading the word of Daraksha discreetly (or at least attempting to). 

Brugo left his village against his families wishes and set out to find a method of spreading the word of Daraksha without causing chaos (spoiler...he failed). 

The pair travelled to Ordo Sapientum. Brugo attempted to continue preaching the word of Daraksha in a variety of ways, leaflets, back-alley conversation, billboard advertisements and eventually became a hobo rambling on the street. The problem was, every time he tried to innocently spread the word of Daraksha, chaos ensued...leaflets gave people paper-cuts leading to worse complications, the billboard fell and crushed a mageâ€™s workshop unleashing magic fireworks in the sky and setting fire to a carnival nearby, back-alley conversations often ended up with someone tripping on a rock and cascading into a crowd (like dominoes this type of incident got worse and worse). There was no end to it. So, the council intervened; they modified Brugos memories, enchanting him to believe he hated Ordo Sapientum and sent him on his way. From there he wandered around till he arrived at Porta Fortune.

As for goals, Brugo is looking for knowledge that can teach him about chaos, he wants to learn about how he can continue his worship of Daraksha without unintentionally causing issues on a great scale. He is also looking for a way to get a good nap, ever since he was young, he has never been able to sleep in peace, because of his family, and now that he has Meredith the strife continues.



### Enemies

Nope, everyone is equal (equally susceptible to discord) under the guise of Daraksha.

### Family

- Meredith - Robin (bird) familiar granted by Daraksha
- Brugo's parents were once part of an adventuring party together but split up shortly after he was born. His mother is a cleric of Daraksha. She is indoctrinated in the cult and causes chaos wherever she goes. She has somehow developed a reputation of being a healer despite being more of a witch doctor. Brugo's father is a Paladin of Kalyari and has adopted a very pious and reserved life after he split with Brugo's mother. 
- Big family with lots of siblings. They are an actual cult with an emphasis on creating mass chaos any way they can. They are well respected in the community because the family have always been naturally talented at creating discord. 
- Veera Thestral - Mother, cleric of Daraksha
- Bridge Crowley - Father, paladin of Kalyari. Mormon-like family desperately trying to bring Brugo to Kalyari



### Attachments

Brugo has managed to alienate everyone he has come into contact with, outside of his family.

### Vices

- Alcohol
- Public Speaking
- Meredith has major avaian superiority issues (everyone other than birds are unevolved apes)

### Secrets

Brugo is struggling with his faith in Daraksha. He doesn't understand chaos like his family and seems to think he has a lack for its talent. Deep down he thinks he is not worthy of following Daraksha and thinks he would have been better suited born into the worship of another god. Though he has never said these thoughts out loud for fear of actualising them. On the surface he has fooled himself into believing he is a devout believer and just going through a rough patch. (but i want to specify that i would rather his love for Daraksha be strengthened over time as opposed to him ever actually leaving her for another god)

### Additional Information

Chaos theory is a predominant factor in this character. Feel free to make it so that whatever can go wrong, goes wrong. 

Meredith will be doing a portion of Brugo's dialogue

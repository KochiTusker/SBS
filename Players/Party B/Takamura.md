### Roleplay Questions



### Upbringing

Takamura was orphaned at a young age in Lex Veritas and his early days were spent growing up on the streets. He longed for a belonging and very soon that came in the form of a man named Morlan â€œGravedustâ€ Veyne. Morlan saw potential in Takamura and brought him into his growing crime family within the Gallowshade Brotherhood. There were other children in Morlanâ€™s ragtag group which he used as pickpockets and thieves. Takamura became known as Tak amongst the Brotherhood and showed great promise, rising quickly through his adopted fatherâ€™s ranks. Here, he fell in love with another orphan brought in by Morlan known as Naeva â€œAshlingâ€ Corvane. They planned their entire lives together from succeeding Morlan as leaders of their group, to growing old together, retiring with hoards of wealth.

Morlan trained Tak to fight for himself, and Tak quickly learned the ways of the Open Hand. His team were small but they were very close knit. Tak and Naeva became Morlanâ€™s most trusted partners, leading their own robberies and terror operations. Tak started to question whether this was his lifeâ€™s purpose and started to wonder what his greater purpose was, and whether this would be what his parents would have wanted for him. 

His life changed in one night, Tak and Naeva planned to rob a temple of Bhargo on the outskirts of Iusticar. It would be the perfect heist with little protection and vast sums of wealth being moved. However, when they got there it all went sideways. The cargo was heavily guarded and in the fray of the fight, Tak became separated from his group. Tak was slashed deep in his torso, with cut from his abdomen to his neck. His wounds had incapacitated him and just when he thought he was about to die, he was saved by a cleric of Bhargo. The cleric preached to him a message of love, justice, righteousness and discipline, and gave Tak the greater purpose he so desperately sought. Tak joined the temple and became an avid follower of Bhargo. He even used his skills for good, training new recruits to defend against the strikes of the Gallowshade Brotherhood. 

It was 10 years later when he recognised a familiar face in a tavern near his temple. He followed them to where he discovered there was an operation taking place in Porta Fortuna. Tak took it upon himself to enact the will of Bhargo and followed them to find out more. (Will flesh this out when I decide what they were up to but essentially you will be following your lead which will bring you together in a shared goal with the rest of the party) 


### Motivation

Tak is following an old Brotherhood member who he suspects of committing a great crime. As soon as Tak engages with the Gallowshade, they will know he is still alive and will start going after him.

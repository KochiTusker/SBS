### Roleplay Questions

<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>

### Motivation
Amos is driven by vengeance and grief. His parents were assassinated by cultist followers of Ozrik Vale after participating in Vale’s imprisonment. Amos seeks their killers and yearns to reclaim forbidden knowledge to ensure their sacrifices were not in vain. He now walks the line between light and shadow, guided by vengeance and the secrets of his own bloodline.

### Enemies
Amos despises the cult of Ozrik Vale and hunts its scattered followers. He mistrusts zealots, inquisitors, and any who bury truth in secrecy or silence.

### Family
- Parents – deceased, slain by cultists of Ozrik Vale
- No known surviving relatives

### Attachments
Amos forms bonds reluctantly, fearing the same fate will befall anyone he cares for. His most trusted companion is his ghost cat, a fragment of his own shadow given form.

### Upbringing
Raised in Ordo Sapientium among scholars and mages, Amos was steeped in secrecy and forbidden texts. His childhood was marked by quiet study and a sense of looming dread. His gift for shadow magic emerged early, seen as a dangerous omen among the Elders.

### Vices
Amos is drawn to forbidden knowledge, unable to resist prying into secrets even when doing so places him or his companions at risk.

### Secrets
Amos suspects his power is not purely his own. In his darkest dreams, he sees a figure of shadow watching him through the eyes of his ghost cat, as if his soul has already been claimed by something older than himself.

### Homebrew Item
**Shadebound Companion – Miloz the Ghost Cat**
*Wondrous Feature, Rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer with Shadow Magic)*

A spectral cat of smoke and moonlight that slinks at Amos’ side. It is bound to his soul, vanishing in sunlight and reappearing in shadow.

---

#### Base Powers (Rare Tier)
- **Spectral Form.** The cat uses the Cat stat block but is incorporeal. It cannot attack or interact physically. AC 12, HP 1, Speed 40 ft., Darkvision 60 ft. If reduced to 0 HP, it vanishes and reforms after a short or long rest.
- **Bonded Familiar.** Functions like *Find Familiar*, except Amos does not cast it. The ghost cat is always present in dim light or darkness. In bright light, it flickers and cannot be summoned.
- **Shared Senses.** As an action, Amos can see and hear through the cat until the start of his next turn, becoming blind and deaf to his surroundings.
- **Shadow Meld.** Once per long rest, the ghost cat cloaks Amos in shadow for 1 minute, granting advantage on Stealth checks and imposing disadvantage on the first attack made against him each round.

#### Scaling Growth (for DM discretion / milestones)
- **Umbral Step (~Level 8–10):** Once per short rest, if Amos and the cat are within 30 ft., they may instantly swap places (no action required).
- **Death’s Watch (~Level 12–14):** If Amos is reduced to 0 HP within 10 ft. of the cat, it may vanish to restore him to 1 HP. It cannot reform until the next dawn.
- **Twin Eclipse (~Level 16+):** Once per week, Amos can split his shadow through the cat. For 1 minute, he gains advantage on Concentration checks and may cast a single spell of 3rd level or lower through the cat as though it were the caster’s location.

---

#### Balance Notes
- At Rare tier, the ghost cat is essentially a familiar with one special trick (*Shadow Meld*), comparable in strength to Thalwen’s Eluvian Mirror’s limited teleport.
- Growth abilities scale the cat into a dramatic but not overwhelming companion.
- Capstone (*Twin Eclipse*) provides narrative and mechanical punch without overshadowing class features.

### Additional Information
- Sees himself as cursed, yet secretly clings to his ghost cat as proof he is not fully alone.
- His grief manifests as sharp sarcasm and mistrust, though he is fiercely loyal once trust is earned.

### Basic Information

- **Subclass:** Swashbuckler
- **Place of Origin:** Thalassa
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>
- **Alias:** The Nightborne Tithe

### Roleplay Questions

### Motivation

Halen seeks to overthrow the rich and powerful, tearing down corrupt institutions that prey on the common folk. He believes wealth has concentrated into the hands of a few, and he wants to redistribute power to those who have none. His vigilante work has brought him to Porta Fortuna, where the greatest fortunes and cruelties intersect.

### Enemies
- Thalassan merchants, known for cunning corruption and predatory trade.
- Possibly Queen Seraphina and others who were allied with Vaeril Sildore, the late corrupt official.
- Much of the upper class, whom he views as complicit in systemic abuse.

### Family
- **Father:** High Magistrate Caelion Velarion (merchant elite of Thalassa)
- **Mother:** Matron Lysandra Velarion
- They come from a long line of wealthy businesspeople in Thalassa.
- Halen still associates with them, though his values diverge strongly from theirs.

### Attachments

- **Sylwen Aeloria (Half-Elf)** – Maid and childhood friend.
  - Knows Halen’s alter ego.
  - Helped him find information on corrupt dealings.
  - Trusted completely, though her safety is a concern if the truth ever spreads.
- Family – despite their differences, he still feels conflicted ties to them.

### Upbringing
Halen grew up in luxury, but spent his childhood in common spaces with poorer children, against his parents’ wishes. There he saw stark class disparity. He befriended Sylwen, a half-elf he secretly loved, who later became his family’s maid. His disguise as a half-orc vigilante is a nod to her heritage.
He witnessed how the wealthy evicted families, bound them in unpayable loans, and profited from their misery. These experiences forged his hatred of the upper class.

#### Just Before the Campaign

While working with the Black Sable Pact, Halen tracked missing people to Vaeril Sildore, Grand Chancellor of the Sildore Exchange. Sildore had been forcing debtors into the mines of the Badlands. Halen ambushed his coach outside Porta Fortuna, assassinating him and his guards. A single guard escaped.
Since then, Halen has been hiding in Porta Fortuna under the guise of the Nightborne Tithe. Authorities have yet to connect Halen with his alter ego.

### Vices
Deeply untrusting of the rich, he clings to strong biases and refuses to see their perspectives. His convictions rarely shift unless proven with irrefutable evidence.

### Secrets

Halen’s alter ego, **The Nightborne Tithe**, is a swashbuckling half-orc vigilante persona.
- He stole the identity from a man he once knew, claiming it as both disguise and symbol of rebellion.
- His first kill left him shaken, but with time killing became easier—disturbingly so after assassinating Sildore.
- He harbours feelings for Sylwen, though would prioritise her safety over any confession.

### Homebrew Item
**Rings of Actual Power** (a matched set):
- **Ring of Flying:** 1 charge/day, 1 minute of flight, no disadvantage.
- **Ring of Disguise Self:** 1 charge/day, lasts until next long rest. Disguise limited to a single alter ego.

### Additional Information
- Has never been outside of Thalassa before.
- Currently laying low in Porta Fortuna, taking small jobs.
- Lives in a townhouse with his parents.
- Hideout above the **Coin & Compass Tavern**, near the docks. The bar owner is an ally and knows the truth of his alter ego.

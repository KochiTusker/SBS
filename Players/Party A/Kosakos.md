### Roleplay Questions
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>

**Motivation**

* They were tasked by the temple of Varnesh to leave Lex Veritas and bring protection to those who dwell beyond the city’s walls. Renewal cannot happen only within halls of law—it must be carried into the chaos of the fractured world.
* Personally, they may be seeking a place where they are not always seen as “tiefling first, cleric second.”

**Enemies**

* Cynical mercenaries — Those who serve only coin and abandon allies when the price is right. It violates everything Varnesh’s twilight represents
* Xenophobic magistrates in Lex Veritas — Judges and officials who saw him only as a tiefling, not as a person. He has special contempt for those who weaponize law to exclude rather than to protect.

**Family**

* Clergy of Varnesh
* Kosakos was taken in by Highwarden Elthira Solmere after his parents died. Elthira is a high elf who was a lifelong cleric of Varnesh.

**Attachments**

* Highwarden Ethira Solmere

**Upbringing**
* Kosakos was born to a family already under scrutiny—tieflings in Lex Veritas were seen by some as echoes of old pacts, tolerated but never trusted. They often became a scapegoat of a vocal minority of the population. Kosakos’ parents themselves were tradespeople, devoted to Bhargo.
* At age 14, a plague swept through Kosakos’ town of Halewatch. Fearmongering spread by vocal minorities began to take hold and drove many to turn on tiefling families, blaming “infernal taint” for the sickness. When his parents died of the plague, it was a priest of Varnesh who took him in—binding wounds, holding vigils, and teaching that renewal was possible even through suffering.
* From that day, Kosakos swore his life to Varnesh, not out of piety alone, but out of gratitude.
* Instead of breaking, they sought belonging in the most disciplined place possible: the temples of Varnesh. Where other gods promised might or vengeance, Varnesh’s creed of unity and renewal offered something they had never known. Acceptance.


**Vices**

* He’d never admit it aloud, but he envies those who live simple, unburdened lives—farmers, merchants, carefree adventurers. He feels chained to duty, and sometimes that envy curdles into bitterness.
* Vice in play: A temptation to abandon the burden, even briefly—gambling, drinking, or chasing fleeting joys


**Secret**

* In his early twenties—before he fully embraced his vows—he fell in love with someone from outside the faith. For a brief time, he lived that ordinary life he always envied: working a menial trade, laughing at market stalls, dreaming of a family. It ended when his lover bore a child.
* Panicked by the weight of responsibility and the fear that his infernal blood would taint the child’s future, he fled back to the temple. He told himself he was “returning to duty,” but the truth is, he abandoned them.
* The temple never knew. He never sought them out again. To this day, he doesn’t know if his child is alive, dead, or grown into something else.


### Homebrew Item: Twilight's Chain

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (requires attunement)*
Legends speak of Mavendral, the Sovereign Below, who forged the first Twilight Chains as oaths of surrender between dying kings and their heirs. The metal remembers compassion through endurance — pain shared is pain divided. When the light wanes, the chain does not command loyalty but solidarity. Some say the final link of each Twilight Chain is left deliberately unclosed, symbolising that no bond — no matter how sacred — is without cost.A length of silver-black chain links two crescent clasps, each etched with runes of dusk and dawn. When worn, the metal hums faintly with the sound of overlapping heartbeats. Its enchantment is said to have been forged in the brief moments between sunset and moonrise — a bond born of shared peril and fleeting light.

**Base Powers (Rare Tier, ~Level 5–10)**

* **Twilight Binding** As a bonus action, you can bind yourself and up to two willing creatures within 30ft together for 1 minute. Threads of pale light coil around your arms, forming celestial chains that bind to the targets. While bound, when one bound creature takes damage, another bound ally gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt (rounded down). These temporary hit points fade at the end of the next turn. If a bound creature is reduced to 0 HP, another bound ally may use their reaction to roll one death saving throw on their behalf. If multiple rolls are made, the better result applies.

**Scalable Growth**

* **Chain of Twofold Heart (Very Rare, ~Level 12):** You may bind three creatures (yourself included) instead of two. When one gains temporary hit points through this feature, they also gain a +1 bonus to AC until the start of their next turn.
* **Dusk's Reprieve (Very Rare → Legendary, ~Level 15):** Once per long rest, when any bound creature is reduced to 0 HP, the chain may instead shatter to restore them to 1 HP. The fragments melt into silver mist and reform at dawn.
* **Eternal Link (Legendary, ~Level 17):** The chain becomes semi-sentient. Once per week, it can bind across planes (range: 1 mile, as long as you know the target personally). When invoked this way, the link lasts for 1 round and conveys brief telepathy and emotional awareness before fading.

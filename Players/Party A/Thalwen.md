### Roleplay Questions

<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>

### Motivation
Thalwen was born just before The Great Silence in Sylvarum Libertas 400 years ago. She is too young to remember why they left, but she knows her parents sent her away before something terrible happened. She was taken to Lex Veritas to live with her uncle, Pontrel, a cleric of Samvrit converted by missionaries years before. Thalwen grew up not knowing why she had to leave, but followed in her uncle’s footsteps and was brought into the fold of the Samvritists. She served in a part-time militia led by Uncle Pontrel that fought smugglers and thieves targeting the cathedrals and temples. Pontrel was slain during a fierce clash with agents of the Hollow Coin Syndicate. His death shattered Thalwen’s faith in Samvrit, setting her on a path of vengeance. Following the Syndicate’s trail has now led her to Porta Fortuna.

### Enemies
Thalwen harbours deep hatred for smugglers and criminals who prey on the weak, particularly the **Gallowshade Brotherhood** and the **Hollow Coin Syndicate**.

### Family
- Parents – deceased, from Virelia
- Uncle Pontrel (cleric of Samvrit) – deceased
- Members of her former druid circle, the **Ashen Bloom** – unknown fate

### Attachments
Thalwen is not especially attached to other people, but the death of animals and the destruction of nature weighs heavily on her heart.

### Upbringing
Thalwen grew up alone in the woods, often spending time in shifted form. She has little experience with civilisation and cannot recall what it feels like to live among communities.

### Vices
Thalwen loves animals intensely and cannot resist giving them affection, even when inconvenient or dangerous.

### Secrets
When her uncle was killed by the Hollow Coin Syndicate, Thalwen did not only hesitate — she fled. She left him to die alone, and never told anyone the truth. By the time she returned, the Syndicate was gone, and she claimed she had been knocked unconscious in the skirmish. Her uncle’s fellow clerics never suspected, but Thalwen knows she could have stood her ground. The shame haunts her, fuelling her hatred of smugglers not just for their cruelty, but for what they revealed about her own cowardice.

### Homebrew Item
**Eluvian Mirror**
*Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a druid)*
A hand-sized mirror framed in silvered ivy, its surface ripples faintly like moonlit water. When gazed into, it shows not the viewer’s face but places they have walked beneath the sky. The mirror binds to memory and moonlight, guiding its wielder along paths once travelled.

#### Base Powers (Rare Item Tier)
- **Moonlit Recall.** As an action, you can speak a command word while holding the mirror to teleport yourself (and up to one willing creature touching you) to a location you have personally visited within the last 7 days. Range: 10 miles. Usable once per long rest.
- **Silver Path.** While attuned, you always know the direction to the nearest moonlit clearing, body of water, or grove of trees within 1 mile — a druid’s compass.
- **Memory’s Edge.** When using the mirror, there’s a faint risk of being “misplaced.” Roll a d20: on a 1, you arrive within 1d10 — 10 feet of your intended spot in a random direction.

#### Scaling Growth (for DM discretion / milestones)
- **Unfading Reflection (Unlocked ~Level 8–10):** The 7-day limit increases to 30 days, and range expands to 100 miles. You can now bring up to two allies.
- **Through the Veil (Unlocked ~Level 12–14):** Once per long rest, the mirror can transport you across planar boundaries to the Feywild or Shadowfell — but only to places you’ve been before. After use, roll a DC 15 Wisdom save: on a failure, you suffer one level of exhaustion from strain.
- **Living Archive (Unlocked ~Level 16+):** The mirror begins to show places erased by memory or history. Once per week, you can attempt to teleport to a place you only know of through story or dream (DM decides success and accuracy).

#### Balance Notes
- At Rare tier, the mirror is essentially a short-range *Teleport* with strong restrictions (recently visited, short distance, daily limit). This is on par with Rare items like *Amulet of the Planes* (though far less powerful) or *Cape of the Mountebank*.
- Its progression pushes it into Very Rare or even Legendary territory, but only if you choose to unlock those higher features later.
- The risk of misplacement keeps it grounded in tension, forcing careful use.

### Additional Information
- Prefers the company of beasts to people.
- Carries grief beneath calm composure, but vengeance burns quietly beneath the surface.

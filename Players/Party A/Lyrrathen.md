### Roleplay Questions
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>

### Motivation

Lyra seeks to explore the world and discover her place in it. Growing up in Cindralux, she was surrounded by creativity, unrest, and political change. The secession of Novum Fabrica shaped her worldview, and though she sided with the secessionists, she never took part directly. Now, leaving Cindralux for the first time, she begins her journey in Thalassa, drawn by wanderlust and the hope of forging her own identity.

### Enemies

- Holds strong prejudice against dwarves, especially those of Caelum Ardens.
- Particularly despises Morgrin Stonecrown and his son Tharnak, viewing them as betrayers of kin and embodiments of dwarven cruelty.

### Family
- **Mother:** Faerithiel Emberveil
- **Father:** Oryndor Emberveil
- **Sister:** Thyrrisane Emberveil (b. 1 CE) – a seamstress in Cindralux, closest to Lyra, acted as a second mother figure. Rejects her fey heritage.
- **Brothers:**
  - Vaelthorin Emberveil (b. 30 CE)
  - Caerindor Emberveil
  - Sylvaranth Emberveil
  - Dhaelion Emberveil
  - Myrrathor Emberveil
- Lyra’s family is large, but her bond with Thyrrisane is strongest due to her sister’s nurturing role during childhood.

### Attachments

Her family remains the most important anchor in her life. Their struggles and sacrifices weigh heavily on her, and she carries their hopes with her on her journey.

### Upbringing
- Born in 60 CE in Ordo Sapientium to refugee parents displaced by the 100 Years War.
- Raised in a poor household in Cindralux.
- Her parents urged her to excel in school, impressing on her the need to rise above their circumstances.
- Political unrest during her youth pushed her sympathies toward Novum Fabrica, though she never acted as more than a supporter.
- Cindralux’s diversity and artistry inspired her thirst for exploration, though she never once left the city until the campaign began.

### Vices

- Lyra cannot resist uncovering hidden truths — books sealed in vaults, whispered gossip, or forbidden knowledge. She often goes too far, prying into matters best left untouched. This vice makes her invaluable as an investigator, but it ties directly into her dracolich lineage: every secret she uncovers risks pulling her closer to Veyzathar’s whispers.

- She is easily distracted by big dogs which she loves to pet.

### Secrets

Lyra’s draconic heritage does not descend from a radiant wyrm, but from Veyzathar the Black Maw, a dracolich of legend whose body lies buried in the deepest ravines of the Varranth Spine. Though its skeletal remains are scattered and forgotten, one fragment of its spine — a shard of bone humming with necrotic memory — survived.

Centuries later, this fragment came into the possession of an Ordo Sapientium mage, who studied its lingering essence. When the mage died, they were buried with the relic, their tomb sealed in the highlands of Luminara.

Lyra, haunted by dreams of whispers calling her “blood of the Maw,” felt compelled to seek the relic. Against her better judgment, she desecrated the mage’s tomb, stealing the fragment. Binding it into a carved staff, she awakened a sliver of the dracolich’s power within herself. The staff grants her access to necromancy spells her bloodline alone could not command — but each use strengthens the connection between Lyra and the restless spirit of Veyzathar.

Her greatest fear is that she is not merely borrowing power, but slowly becoming the vessel through which her ancestor might return.

### Homebrew Item

#### Base Properties

Weapon: Quarterstaff (counts as a magical weapon).
Effect: Grants a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs for necromancy spells.
Limitations: The staff holds 3 charges, regained after a long rest.

#### Abilities (Scaling by Level)

At 5th level
- Necrotic Strike: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you may spend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.
- Bone Grasp (1 charge): As an action, cast Arms of Hadar or False Life.

At 10th level
- Staff becomes a +2 focus for necromancy spells.
- Withering Pulse (2 charges): As an action, cast Animate Dead without components. The staff reshapes nearby bones or detritus into skeletal servants.
- Necrotic Strike damage increases to 2d6.

At 15th level
- Staff becomes a +3 focus for necromancy spells.
- Spectral Maw (3 charges): As an action, you unleash the echo of Veyzathar’s roar. Each creature of your choice within 30 ft must make a Constitution save (DC = your spell save DC). On a fail, they take 6d8 necrotic damage and are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On success, they take half damage and are not frightened.
- Necrotic Strike damage increases to 3d6.

#### Drawback

Whenever you expend the staff’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the dracolich’s spirit stirs:
You gain one level of Exhaustion until you finish a long rest.
During that time, you hear whispers of Veyzathar urging you to betray your companions.

### Additional Information
- Lyra has never travelled beyond Cindralux until now.
- She is witty, curious, and quick to speak her mind, but her naivety in the wider world may leave her vulnerable.

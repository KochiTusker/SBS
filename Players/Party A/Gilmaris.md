**Upbringing**
Gil grew up in a coastal enclave of High Elves located on the border between Thalassa and Novum Fabrica. The enclave was reclusive but hospitable to travellers. During his youth, a storm swept him into the sea, where his latent druidic powers awakened, allowing him to survive. This event was witnessed by Caldarion, a druid of the Circle of the Seas, who took Gil under his wing.

Together they journeyed towards Luminara, honing Gil’s connection to the tides. Caldarion instilled in him the importance of balance — that power from the sea must be met with respect and care for it.

Their travels led them to Cindralux, where Gil stumbled upon a horrific necromantic ritual involving Inarcanus sacrifices. In his haste to stop it, he unleashed the sea’s fury, accidentally killing an apprentice. The ritual ended, but the sea turned crimson and an abyssal scream echoed — a memory that still haunts him. Pursued by Ordo Sapientium, Gil and Caldarion fled to Thalassa. On the road to Porta Fortuna, they were attacked by raiders from the Badlands. Caldarion gave Gil his **Tidecaller’s Conch** and urged him to run. They were separated, and Gil does not know if his teacher survived.

Now in Porta Fortuna, Gil lives in hiding, torn between returning home to his family — risking their safety — or completing the pilgrimage to Lake Serathun without his master.

**Vices**

* Reckless wanderlust

**Secret**

* He killed a student of the Ordo who was practicing necromancy on Inarcanus. Fearing capture, he fled back to Thalassa and then onward to Porta Fortuna.

### Homebrew Item: Tidecaller’s Conch

*Wondrous Item, Rare → scales to Very Rare / Legendary (requires attunement by a druid of the Circle of the Seas)*
A pale-blue conch shell threaded with silver veins of moonlight. When held to the ear, it always echoes with the sound of waves, no matter where you are.

**Base Powers (Rare Tier, ~Level 5–10)**

* Once per long rest, you can transform into living water for 1 minute (*as gaseous form*, but liquid instead of vapor).
* While in this form, you can slip through cracks and cannot be grappled.
* **Whisper of the Tides.** You can breathe underwater and gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.
* **Mariner’s Guidance.** While at sea, you always know true north, the nearest land within 10 miles, and the direction of prevailing winds.

**Scalable Growth**

* **Unfettered Wave (Very Rare, ~Level 11–14):** Gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. You can cast *Tidal Wave* once per long rest without expending a spell slot.
* **Voice of the Storm (Very Rare → Legendary, ~Level 15–17):** Add your Wisdom modifier to one damage roll when casting cold, lightning, or thunder spells. Once per long rest, summon a Storm Elemental (use Water Elemental stats with lightning damage) for 1 minute.
* **Call of the Abyss (Legendary, ~Level 18+):** Once per long rest, blow the conch to invoke the abyssal depths:

  * *Maelstrom:* All creatures of your choice within 60 ft. must make a Strength save or be pulled 30 ft. toward a vortex (difficult terrain for 1 minute).
  * *Tempest:* Summon a storm (*Control Weather*) for 10 minutes, centered on your position.
* While holding the conch, you cannot drown.

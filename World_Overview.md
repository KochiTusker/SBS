# World Overview

- The world is divided into two vast continents: **Caelovar**, where the campaign begins, and **Virelia**, a land that fell silent centuries ago.

- **Caelovar** is defined by its mountains and fractured nations. Once plagued by goliath raiders, it became the cradle of civilisation when the clerics of Samvrit founded Lex Veritas. The dwarven empire of Manus Titanum, forged by Durgin Ironheart, rose from these mountains but later collapsed into civil war. Today, the continent is locked in the 100 Years War, a stalemate between the city-states of the broken empire.

- **Virelia**, once a thriving continent with rich trades and cultures, has been shrouded in mystery since the Great Silence of 300 BCE. No expedition has returned, and rumours of lost empires, vanished peoples, and dark forces linger in taverns across Caelovar.

- The campaign begins in **100 CE**, an age of uncertainty. Dwarven kingdoms bleed themselves dry, **Thalassa** grows rich at an unprecedented scale, **Novum Fabrica** and **Ordo Sapientium** clash in their philosophies.

  Whispers of warforged spread once more across the seas — constructs outside the Wheel, tied to **Daraksha**’s pact with **Drazkul**. Their resurgence is a sign that the cycle may break again.

  The Triad of Balance — Samvrit, Ishvarael, and Varnesh — suspect Daraksha’s hand in their resurgence, but lack proof strong enough to justify divine judgment. The warforged schemata, relics of forbidden creation once sealed within Esochrein’s Vaults, were stolen by the Hollow Coin Syndicate at her unseen prompting.
  
  Each warforged carries a soul that should have returned to the Wheel — prisoners once taken by Drazkul Vurntash or victims captured by other warforged. Their bondage denies the Wheel its rhythm, slowly unbalancing life and death.
  
  As their numbers grow, the Triad feel the strain reverberate through the cosmos. Should the balance tip further, they may act as they once did at the end of the last age — unmaking the world to restore order.

## Major Plotline – History

- The deeper past of the world is obscured by mystery. Scattered ruins hint at civilisations lost in a cataclysm more than ten thousand years ago, but little remains beyond broken stones and unanswered questions.

- From **3000 BCE**, history becomes clearer. This was the Era of the Goliath, when towering warbands roamed Caelovar, razing any settlement that tried to take root. Survival meant constant movement until, in 2000 BCE, the clerics of Samvrit established Iusticar. Blessed weapons and faith held the goliaths at bay, though the struggle remained a stalemate for centuries.

- Change came with **Durgin Ironheart**, a dwarven battle-captain who abandoned honourable combat in favour of brutal ambushes and raids. His tactics broke the goliaths’ power and forced them across the sea to Virelia. For his cruelty, Durgin was exiled from Lex Veritas, but he went on to forge the dwarven empire of Manus Titanum in the mountains.

- Generations later, under **Empress Magra Stonecrown**, Manus Titanum expanded to its height of power. Magra envisioned an empire of diplomacy as much as conquest, preparing her eldest son Thrainor to inherit her crown. But her death in 0 CE fractured the realm. Thrainor claimed the throne, while his brother Morgrin declared rebellion, plunging the empire into the 100 Years War.

- Now, in **100 CE**, the war drags on as a stalemate. Entire bloodlines have been extinguished, alliances tested, and nations reshaped. And yet, beyond the battlefields, darker whispers spread:
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>
  Those who know the forbidden histories of the War of the Forgotten understand the truth. The Silence was not a natural calamity, but the aftermath of Drazkul Vurntash’s conquest. His warforged legions swept across Virelia, enslaving its people and binding their souls into iron shells.
  
  When the dirge cores that powered those legions began to fail, their hosts disintegrated and the freed spirits surged back into the Wheel, nearly tearing it apart. The Triad of Balance intervened — sealing Virelia in divine silence to contain the rupture.
  
  For four centuries, that silence has endured. No ship bound for Virelia has ever returned, their wrecks lost to the Sea of Dread or to the guardians that remain upon its shores. The re-emergence of warforged on Caelovar is not the return of survivors, but proof that the stolen schemata of their making have been found and used anew.

  The miners in the Badlands work against their will, trapped in debt to the Sildore Exchange, a Thalassan merchant bank turned predatory loan shark. To pay off their bondage, they extract rare earth metals sold by Ash & Ledger to the Hollow Coin Syndicate. These metals vanish overseas, feeding secret forges where warforged are made. Recently, some of these constructs have appeared in the 100 Years War, bolstering Tharnak Stonecrown’s forces.

  Khardek Stonecrown did not build a grand design so much as lash out in bitterness. Forever overshadowed by his siblings, he poisoned Magra and Thrainor not to claim their thrones but to see their legacies ruined. Retreating into Ferraria Tenebris, he steeped himself in spite and secrecy.

  Through reckless bargains such as the **Dustvale Accord**, Khardek bartered away fragments of Manus Titanum’s heritage for forbidden aid. It was this act of desperation that allowed **Drazkul Vurntash** to ferry the warforged across the sea. To Khardek, they were perfect weapons to wound Ferrum Regnum — silent, tireless, and underestimated, much as he himself had been.

  What he failed to grasp was that their resurgence threatened the Wheel itself. Souls bound into steel, denied their return, unravel the cosmic balance. In his pettiness, Khardek opened a door for chaos far greater than he could ever understand, his spite serving the designs of powers beyond his control.

  The existence of the warforged threatens the wheel. Souls that would be claimed and returned to the wheel are trapped in mechanical bodies. Even broken warforged that seem beyond repair have a dirge core that binds souls to the steel. As chaos builds, the gods start turning the wheel towards another reset in order to preserve the cosmic order. Chaos itself threatens the stability of the wheel. Daraksha's meddling is geared to destabilise the wheel. If the chaos she brings to the world gets to a level that the wheel cannot handle before another reset occurs, it will fall apart, tearing apart the cosmic order and allowing Daraksha to seize it and mould reality to her will.

  The Triad of Balance — Samvrit, Ishvarael, and Varnesh — stand apart from the rest of the pantheon. They alone can act directly if the Wheel falters, for their strength is bound to its turning rather than mortal worship. All other gods, even the mightiest, must work through the hands of mortals.

  Among them, Aurelion Threx trembles in secret. The warforged did not simply slaughter his zealots — they shattered the hierarchies and chains that sustained his stolen divinity. His empire of law was his altar, and its breaking has left him weakened. Yet to mortals he presents only fire and certainty, masking fear with the illusion of unbroken strength.

## Major Events

- **The War of the Forgotten (600–300 BCE):** In distant Virelia, fractured empires clashed in a conflict now remembered only in fragments. Refugees spoke of entire nations vanishing, their histories erased, their legacies drowned in silence. The war ended abruptly and mysteriously, leaving only ruins and broken memories.
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>
  The War of the Forgotten was Virelia’s last great struggle before the Silence. Drazkul unleashed his warforged against Dominatus Rex, binding souls into steel to stave off collapse. Though he won battles, the war consumed his people, leaving only husks of once-great civilisations. Daraksha’s pact with him marked the desperate final act of a doomed continent.

- **The Warforged and the Pact of Souls** During the desperate days of the Duergar exodus, Drazkul Vurntash forged a forbidden pact with the goddess Daraksha, who had herself sown the chaos that drove the refugees to ruin. In exchange for their salvation, Drazkul was taught to bind dying souls into mechanical vessels called Dirge Cores — devices that could power constructs of steel and stone. These souls, fractured and incomplete, became the first warforged. Their creation was not a triumph of artifice but a theft from death and the wheel itself. The Dirge Cores could not hold souls indefinitely; over time, the spirit fragments faded, leaving only echoes of pain and the mechanical reflex to obey. In the recent years, Ferraria Tenebris has traded with Drazkul to replicate or prolong the Dirge technology, seeking to make the constructs last longer. Yet even now, the warforged sometimes cry out fragments of their old lives — memories that surface and vanish like sparks in ash.

- **The Great Silence (300 BCE):** The thriving continent of Virelia fell silent. Expeditions sent to uncover the truth never returned. Its cause remains unknown to most of Caelovar.

- **The Height of Magra Stonecrown’s Empire (c. 0 CE):** Empress Magra blended diplomacy with power, expanding Manus Titanum’s influence. Her death triggered the collapse of imperial unity.

- **The Outbreak of the 100 Years War (0 CE):** Magra’s eldest son Thrainor claimed the throne, but his brother Morgrin rebelled, drawing Caminus Primordialis and Caelum Ardens into conflict. The once-mighty empire splintered into warring city-states.

- **Deaths of Thrainor and Morgrin (85–95 CE):** Thrainor died under suspicious circumstances in 85 CE, followed by Morgrin’s death in 95 CE. Their heirs — Helgrid and Tharnak — now lead Ferrum Regnum and Caelum Ardens respectively.
<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>
  Both deaths were engineered by Khardek Stonecrown, who seeks to shatter the family legacy from within.
</details>

- **The Present Day (100 CE):** The war has ground into stalemate. Alliances strain, bloodlines dwindle. But a new adventure is waiting to begin.

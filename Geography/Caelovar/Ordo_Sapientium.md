# Ordo Sapientium


## Location
- Centred on **Luminara**, in the highlands south of the Varranth Spine.
- Expands to include **Cindralux**, its practical hub of applied magic, and smaller settlements dedicated to research and archives.

## Borders
- Shares land with **Novum Fabrica**, its seceded rival state.
- Mountain passes connect it to Ferrum Regnum and Caminus Primordialis.
- Its neutrality has kept it from constant invasion, though resentment simmers among neighbours.

## Geography
- Rugged uplands broken by crystalline rivers and leyline nodes.
- Cities are built where magical energy is most potent, shaping the land with illusions and enchantments.
- Illusion-woven streets, floating towers, and arcane laboratories dominate its settlements.

## Founding
- **1350 BCE:** Founded by mages from Lex Veritas, many former clerics of Astriara.
- Broke from religious orthodoxy to study the **Weave** directly.
- From its inception, secrecy and the classification of dangerous lore defined the Ordo’s methods.

## Capital
- **Luminara** – a city of shifting streets, teleporting doorways, and libraries that seem alive with spells.
- Attracts wizards, sorcerers, and scholars from across the world, though it disorients outsiders unused to its woven illusions.

## Politics
- Governed by the **Council of Twelve Elders**, each representing a magical discipline (e.g., Transmutation, Conjuration, Necromancy).
- Succession occurs only on death, with the Elder’s life’s work sealed until deemed safe.
- The **Primarch**, chosen annually, serves as ceremonial head and tie-breaker; in crises, they wield near-monarchical power.
- Though the Ordo proclaims itself a meritocracy, merit is measured in mana. Those born without gift are relegated to servitor castes — recorders, attendants, or menials of the great colleges. The **Inarcanus** comprised over sixty percent of the Ordo’s populace before the secession of **Novum Fabrica** but they never seats on its Council. Their discontent, ignored for generations, found voice in **Ozrik Vale**

## Social Hierarchy
- **Elders (Deep Purple Robes):** The ruling elite, shimmering with starlight embroidery.
- **Custodians (Midnight Blue Robes):** Overseers, magistrates, and augurs monitoring law, stars, and extraplanar threats.
- **Practitioners (Crimson Cloaks):** Researchers, magisters, and wardens safeguarding vaults and artefacts.
- **Initiates (Brown Cloaks):** acolytes, adepts.Novices and assistants who copy tomes, assist in rituals, and serve as aides.
- **Inarcanus (Non-mages):** Excluded from government and treated as second-class citizens.

## Culture
- Knowledge is the greatest currency. Intelligence and wisdom matter more than wealth.
- Libraries, laboratories, and archives define civic life. Access to knowledge is strictly vetted, creating deep social divides.
- Outsiders often find the Ordo aloof and insular, but its culture prizes refinement of the mind above all else.

## History
- Rose from clerical rebellion, severing ties with Astriara’s priests in favour of direct study of the Weave.
- Grew into the preeminent magical state of Caelovar.
- **~80 CE:** Ozrik Vale’s secession led to the founding of **Novum Fabrica**, splitting the Ordo in half.
- Lost land and prestige, but retained Luminara and its arcane supremacy.

## Mystical Events
- Once every century, when the stars align, extradimensional libraries drift into Luminara.
- These bring guardians of forbidden knowledge, who challenge candidates to prove their worth.
- Only one outsider in history has succeeded in claiming such knowledge.

## Relations
- Maintains official **neutrality** in the 100 Years War and for everything else, though some Elders with Lex Veritas roots secretly funnel support there.
- Rumours persist of espionage and betrayal: smuggling groups like **Serpent & Ember** have stolen dangerous secrets.
- Its aloof stance breeds mistrust, even as its magical expertise is indispensable.

# The Varranth Spine


The **Varranth Spine** is the largest mountain range in the known world, dominating the northern half of **Caelovar**. Towering peaks, sheer cliffs, and labyrinthine valleys carve a natural barrier across the land, shaping both history and civilisation.

## Historical Significance
- The mountains were the cradle of **Manus Titanum**, the dwarven empire forged by Durgin Ironheart after his exile from Lex Veritas.
- Countless fortresses, citadels, and subterranean forges were hewn into its slopes, many still active, others lost to ruin.
- The Spine became synonymous with dwarven power, its very stone echoing with the legacy of conquest and tragedy.

## Geographic Reach
- The range spans the breadth of northern Caelovar.
- It forms the backbone of four nations: **Lex Veritas**, **Ferrum Regnum**, **Caelum Ardens**, and **Ferraria Tenebris**.
- Valleys between the peaks act as lifelines, hosting rivers, trade routes, and hidden settlements, while the highest passes are snowbound year-round.

## Dangers & Mysteries
- The central valley of the Spine plunges into shadowed depths so vast that **sunlight has never touched them**.
- Explorers whisper of caverns without end, home to creatures unseen elsewhere in the world.
- Old dwarven records speak of **veins of god-metal** buried within, metals said to drink fire, light, and even memory itself.
- Few who descend return, and those who do carry scars, strange markings, or half-mad tales of **things moving in the dark**.

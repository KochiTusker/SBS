# Ferrum Regnum


## Location
- High in the Varranth Spine, at the empire’s geographical and symbolic heart.

## Capital
- Ferrum Regnum itself, a vast mountain citadel.

## Geography
- Built into the Varranth Spine’s peaks.
- Fortified walls, hidden forges, and underground halls lit by molten rivers.
- Known for extreme winters and near-impregnable defences.

## Founding
- Founded by **Durgin Ironheart** in 1490 BCE after his exile from Lex Veritas.

## Politics
- Seat of the Stonecrown line until **Magra Stonecrown's** death.
- Now ruled by **Helgrid Stonecrown**, daughter of Thrainor.

## Culture
- Once rich with art, theatre, and music — now entirely militarised.
- Known for the discipline of its armies and the production of unmatched steel.
- Respected as the bastion of dwarven honour, though others see it as an outdated relic.

## History
- Durgin’s conquests launched from here.
- For centuries, the imperial capital of Manus Titanum.
- Decline set in after Magra’s death.
- In the 100 Years War, Ferrum Regnum fights alongside Caminus Primordialis against Caelum Ardens and Ferraria Tenebris.

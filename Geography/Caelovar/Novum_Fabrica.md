## Location
- Centred on **Cindralux**, straddling the **Liraeth River**.
- Claims territory that once belonged to the Ordo Sapientium, particularly its second city.
- Border towns remain divided between Ordo and Novum control, though many still maintain cross-border ties.
- Shares borders with Ordo Sapientium (west), The East Badlands (east), Lex Veritas (north), Thalassa (south)

## Borders

- Trade routes flow westward toward Thalassa and south into Manus Titanum’s fractured states.

## Geography
- The **Liraeth River** is its lifeline, lined with workshops, mills, and shipping docks.
- Fertile lowlands dotted with towns supply resources for Cindralux’s artisans and artificers.
- The capital is a hub of industry, smoke, and invention, often compared to a forge sprawling across water.

## Founding
- **~80 CE:** Founded by **Ozrik Vale**, an artificer from Manus Titanum.
- Born of resentment among the **Inarcanus**—non-magic users excluded from governance in the Ordo Sapientium.
- Seceded with Cindralux as its capital, declaring a republic devoted to invention and innovation.

- Known for producing unique magical artefacts, some now scattered in the hands of nobles, adventurers, and warlords.

## Politics
- Structured as a **republic**.
- A **Senate of 200 citizens** elects a President every five years.
- In practice, **Ozrik Vale** has remained the sole President since its founding, unchallenged in popularity.
- Senators represent local regions, giving broad representation, though critics argue wealth and influence still dominate.

## Legacy

- Its embrace of innovation has made it a symbol of freedom and possibility, even as others whisper that unchecked invention may prove dangerous.

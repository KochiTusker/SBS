# Lex Veritas


## Location
- Eastern coast of Caelovar, overlooking the great trade routes across the Inner Sea.
- Built upon rocky highlands and cliffs that descend into fortified harbours.

## Borders
- North: Caelum Ardens
- West: Ferrum Regnum
- South: The Badlands

## Geography
- A land of jagged mountains, caves, and ravines.
- Fertile valleys line the coast, but the interior is harsh and treacherous.
- Legends claim the deepest caverns open into the underworld itself.

## Capital City
- **Iusticar**
  - Founded: c. 2000 BCE by clerics and paladins of Samvrit.
  - Description: A fortified coastal city and the heart of Lex Veritas. Cathedrals and judgment halls dominate its skyline, with streets radiating outward from the Hall of Judgment, where the Pontifex and council convene.

## Major Cities
- **Caelumbra:** A scholarly hub devoted to Ishvarael’s clarity and the study of truth. Its illuminated manuscripts and funerary codices are treasured across Caelovar.
- **Aeterna’s Watch:** A fortress-city on the northern passes into Ferrum Regnum. It houses the guardians of Varnesh, known for binding oaths of unity between allied states.
- **Sanctis Mare:** A coastal city dedicated to naval training and trade, where shrines to all three gods of the Triad stand at every harbour gate, reminding sailors that law follows them wherever the sea may take them.

## Founding
- Founded around 2000 BCE by clerics and paladins of Samvrit.
- Established as a bulwark against goliath raiders, with Iusticar serving as the first permanent foothold of civilisation in Caelovar.
- From its beginning, it was shaped not only by Samvrit’s justice but also by Ishvarael’s clarity and Varnesh’s renewal. Together the three became the Triad of Balance, defining the nation’s law and purpose.

## Politics
- Governance functions as a **clerical council** of fifty-five clerics, known as the *Triune Assembly*.
- While three-quarters of its members follow Samvrit, the presence of Ishvarael’s deathwalkers and Varnesh’s diplomats ensures the council speaks with the voice of the entire Triad.
- From this body, the **Pontifex** is elected, ruling as both monarch and high priest. By ancient custom, the Pontifex must be consecrated in all three temples of the Triad, symbolising that law, endings, and renewal govern together.

## Culture
- The Triad of Balance — Samvrit, Ishvarael, and Varnesh — are revered here not simply as gods but as the living embodiment of law itself. Their presence is treated less as religion and more as the foundation of reality. Clerics do not believe they fuel these deities with prayer; rather, by upholding judgment, endings, and renewal, mortals participate in the cosmic order that the Triad sustain.
- Festivals and rituals reflect this triune faith:
  - *Samvrit*: Public trials, soul-weighing ceremonies, and civic renewal rites.
  - *Ishvarael*: Funerary processions, veils of clarity, and festivals of dissolution where falsehoods are ritually burned.
  - *Varnesh*: Unity feasts, oath-binding ceremonies, and dawn vigils symbolising renewal after loss.
- This balance sets Lex Veritas apart from other nations: it is not just a land of worship but the earthly mirror of the Wheel’s eternal turning.

## History
- **2000 BCE:** Clerics of Samvrit establish Iusticar and repel goliath raids.
- **1500 BCE:** Durgin Ironheart is exiled for cruelty and later founds Manus Titanum.
- Lex Veritas endures as the oldest civilisation in Caelovar, claiming authority not by conquest but by law.
- In the 100 Years War, Lex Veritas supports Ferrum Regnum against Caelum Ardens, framing its intervention as a moral duty to preserve order and uphold the Triad’s balance.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>
- The Triad’s presence is strongest here, tied directly to the Wheel of Return. Rituals of judgment, endings, and renewal are not symbolic but enactments that resonate with the Wheel itself.
- Some clerics whisper that Aurelion Threx’s fire has dimmed since the Great Silence. They cannot prove this, nor would they dare voice such suspicion openly, but subtle changes in his Judges’ proclamations have left seeds of doubt.
- In truth, the clergy do not know the depth of his weakness. Only the gods themselves perceive how fragile he has become.
- Ancient caverns beneath the land are said to hold remnants of pre-Reset eras, sealed by divine command of the Triad to prevent their corruption from re-entering the cycle.

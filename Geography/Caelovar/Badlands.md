# The Badlands


## Location
- Two **ungoverned regions** of Caelovar, lying on **opposite coasts** of the continent.
- Separated by the **Spine of Caelovar**, yet alike in character as lawless grasslands.

## Borders
- **Eastern Badlands:** Bordered by Thalassa to the south and Novum Fabrica to the north.
- **Western Badlands:** Stretching from the western foothills of the Spine to the coast, with loose ties to Thalassan trade routes.
- Both regions remain buffer zones, claimed by no crown and ruled by no council.

## Geography
- Vast expanses of **windswept grasslands** with little in the way of arable soil.
- Small-scale **mines and quarries** exist but lack the richness of Caelovarâ€™s mountains.
- Scattered ruins dot the plains, remnants of the **goliath dominion** that once ruled the continent.

## Capital
- None. The Badlands are ungoverned, and no central city has ever endured.

## Major Settlements
- Scattered **tribal encampments**, trading posts, and temporary strongholds.
- Smuggler towns rise and fall quickly, often abandoned once law or rivals close in.

## Founding
- No recorded founding. The Badlands are the **remnant of lands abandoned** after the goliaths were driven into exile (c. 1500 BCE).
- Oral traditions among tribes claim descent from survivors of the goliath exodus, but little written record remains.

## Politics
- Entirely **tribal and nomadic**, with no unifying authority.
- Dozens of clans follow their own laws and traditions, clashing as often as they trade.
- Outlaw brotherhoods and raider groups often hold more sway than tribal elders.

## Culture
- Fiercely **independent** and resistant to outside governance.
- Oral histories, shamanistic rites, and tribal law shape daily life.
- Hospitality is sacred among some clans, but betrayal and raiding are equally common.

## History
- Once part of the **goliath dominion** of Caelovar, the lands fell into disarray after their exile.
- Fragmented into tribes with little record-keeping, much of their history has been lost or mythologised.
- Goliath ruins, barrows, and shrines remain scattered across the plains, often desecrated or plundered.

## Factions
- **The Gallowshade Brotherhood:** Infamous grave-robbers, raiders, and desecrators of shrines. Their name alone spreads fear among caravans.
- Numerous **nomadic clans**, each with their own alliances, rivalries, and rites.
- **Smugglers and mercenaries** use the Badlands as hidden routes between larger nations.

## Foreign Relations
- **Thalassa**: Merchants probe both eastern and western Badlands, bartering with tribes and exploiting smuggling routes.
- Other nations largely avoid direct entanglement, seeing the region as unprofitable and dangerous.

## Current Role
- A haven for **banditry, smuggling, and outlaw activity**.
- A volatile region where adventurers may find **tribal intrigue, lost goliath relics, and lawless opportunity.**

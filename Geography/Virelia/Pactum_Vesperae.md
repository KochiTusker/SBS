## Capital
**Mercatoria Invicta** — the Unconquered Merchant.
A thriving port city at the mouth of the Elowen River, drawing lifeblood from Lake Serathuun upstream. Its docks were perpetually filled with merchant vessels, warships, and exotic cargo. The city’s culture blended tiefling resilience with cosmopolitan wealth, becoming a hub of trade, diplomacy, and resistance.

## Founding Year
c. 921 BCE — established by tiefling rebels fleeing persecution under Dominatus Rex.

## Government & Politics
- **System:** Merchant-oligarchy with elected Merchant-Princes.
- **Council of the Pact:** Representatives from powerful trading houses, guilds, and military leaders.
- **Leadership:** Titles rotated between dominant houses, ensuring no single dynasty could claim absolute power.
- **Foreign Policy:** Defined by defiance against Dominatus Rex and competition with Thalassa for trade supremacy.

## Culture
- Rooted in **tiefling identity** and resistance, but shaped by trade into a cosmopolitan society.
- Merchant houses blended cultural practices from duergar, dwarves, humans, and elves.
- Religion was pluralistic: temples to Astriara, Vayun, and Kalyari stood alongside shrines to patrons of secrecy and survival.
- Art and literature often carried themes of rebellion, exile, and resilience.

## Cities
- **Mercatoria Invicta (Capital):** Centre of trade and defiance, fortified and culturally diverse.
- **Coastal Harbours:** Numerous smaller settlements along the Bay of Fortune, thriving as trade posts and fortified fishing towns.
- **Eastern Secret Ports:** Hidden harbours along the eastern coast of Virelia, used to outmanoeuvre Dominatus Rex and expand trade into Caelovar.

## Geography
- The fertile Elowen River valley provided agriculture, while the Bay of Fortune enabled extensive seafaring.
- Hills and forests inland created natural barriers but also limited expansion, encouraging reliance on maritime strength.

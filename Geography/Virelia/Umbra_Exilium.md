# Umbra Exilium


## Location
North-west Virelia, settled along rivers and fertile floodplains. Bordered by:
- **North:** Ultimus Stirpis
- **East:** Dominatus Rex
- **South:** Pactum Vesperae
- **West:** Coastline of the Shattered Sea

## Capital
None. Umbra Exilium had no centralised capital.

## Cities & Settlements
- **Village Councils:** Each duergar settlement functioned as a semi-autonomous unit, typically blending surface farmsteads with underground burrows.
- **Floodplain Settlements:** Built near rivers for farming and fishing, extending into the soil with subterranean tunnels for defense.
- **Burrowed Strongholds:** Some larger communities carved fortified enclaves underground, echoing their Underdark origins.

## Founding Year
c. 1000 BCE — founded when duergar fled a devastating war in the Underdark and emerged onto the surface.

## Government & Politics
- No unified state — instead, village-by-village governance.
- Councils of elders and artisans guided daily life, focusing on survival and isolationism.
- Extremely cautious in foreign relations; reluctant to ally except when survival demanded it.

## Culture
- Defined by **quiet survival** over conquest or ambition.
- Communities prized **craftsmanship**, **farming**, and **defensive fortifications**.
- Oral traditions preserved memories of their exodus, but records were sparse.
- Insularity was common; outsiders were viewed with suspicion.

## History
- **Exodus (c. 1000 BCE):** Duergar fled the Underdark to escape a devastating conflict.
- **Settlement:** Established farming villages and underground refuges across north-west Virelia.
- **Conflict with Dominatus Rex (pre-300 BCE):** Despite their peaceful nature, they were drawn into war against the expansionist humans. Umbra Exilium allied with Pactum Vesperae, providing hidden fortresses and soldiers.
- **Great Silence (300 BCE):** All contact ceased. No word of the duergar has reached Caelovar since; whether they endured, vanished, or returned underground remains unknown.

# Dominatus Rex


## Location
Dominated the western lowlands of Virelia, occupying fertile plains and river valleys.
- **Capital:** Imperium Solis, on the western coast.
- **Borders:**
  - North: Ultimus Stirpis
  - North-east: Umbra Exilium
  - East: Sylvarum Libertas
  - South: Pactum Vesperae
  - West: Coastline of the Shattered Sea

## Capital
**Imperium Solis** — once a modest trading town, conquered and remade into a grandiose monument of human supremacy. Its streets were lined with slave camps, prisons, and towering statues glorifying humanity’s “divine mandate.” Public parades of captured non-humans symbolised its ideology of dominance.

### Founding Year
c. 1978 BCE (republic established)
c. 1900 BCE (conquest of Imperium Solis and transformation into capital)

## Government & Politics
- **System:** Two-consul republic.
- **Consuls:** Elected for two-year terms by a Senate composed of “pureblood” elites. Many consuls served multiple terms, often drawn from successful generals.
- **Military & Politics:** Inseparable — political status was dictated by military achievement.
- **Law:** Harsh and xenophobic, rooted in the *Codex Primaris*. Non-humans were enslaved, while humans underwent rigid eugenics policies.
- **Magic:** Viewed as corruption; magic users (even humans) were persecuted, imprisoned, or executed.

## Culture
- Shaped by the **Codex Primaris**, which taught that non-humans were “Echoes” or “Refractions” of humanity’s divine essence, created only to serve mankind.
- Worship of **Aurelion Threx** dominated all public life, presenting him as the fulfiller of humanity’s divine destiny.
- Eugenics programs shaped marriage and family life, with entire “breeding halls” devoted to “refining humanity.”
- Art, monuments, and architecture glorified human form and military triumphs.

## Cities
- **Imperium Solis (Capital):** Seat of government, slave camps, and cultural propaganda.
- **Border Garrisons:** Fortified towns along the northern and eastern frontiers, serving as staging points for warbands against goliaths and duergar.
- **Agricultural Villages:** Scattered across fertile lowlands, producing food largely through enslaved labour.

## History
- **Founding (1978 BCE):** Established as a human republic in Virelia’s lowlands.
- **Rise of Imperium Solis (1900 BCE):** Trading town conquered and rebuilt as capital, symbol of supremacy.
- **Wars of Expansion (1900–500 BCE):** Waged war against nearly every neighbour, including:
  - **Umbra Exilium (duergar):** Branded “invaders” from below, targeted with genocidal campaigns.
  - **Ultimus Stirpis (goliaths):** Frequent clashes framed as challenges to human dominance.
  - **Pactum Vesperae:** Prolonged conflict in the south.
- **Suppression of Magic:** Purges and executions of mages marked the later centuries, branding arcane power as heresy.
- **Resistance Movements:** Underground Samvritist communities worked in secret, opposing Threxian clerics and preserving alternative visions of justice.
- **Great Silence (300 BCE):** Contact with Dominatus Rex ceased. No word of Imperium Solis, its senate, or its armies ever reached Caelovar again. Whether undone by enemies, internal collapse, or divine retribution remains unknown.

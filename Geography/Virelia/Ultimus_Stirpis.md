# Ultimus Stirpis


## Location
- Harsh grasslands and desert in central Virelia, with little natural shelter.
- Known for its **colossal trees**, hollowed into fortress-homes by goliath clans.
- North Western corner of Virelia. Sharing borders with Dominatus Rex (south) and Umbra Exilium (east)

## Borders
- Waged war against nearly every neighbour, including **Dominatus Rex, Umbra Exilium, and Pactum Vesperae**.
- By the time of the Great Silence, its exact borders were fluid, constantly shifting with conquest.

## Geography
- Barren plains and **sun-scorched deserts** marked by the occasional massive, ancient tree.
- These trees, hollowed into citadels, served as fortresses, dwellings, and war-councils.
- Scars of endless warfare litter the land—burnt fields, broken stoneworks, and abandoned camps.

## Capital
- No fixed capital. Ultimus Stirpis operated as a **collective of clans**, moving war-councils between the largest fortress-trees.

## Major Settlements
- **Fortress-Trees of the Wastes:** Each goliath clan held a colossal hollowed tree, carved with spiralling ramps, watchtowers, and murals of battle.
- Warbands gathered at these citadels to plan campaigns and celebrate victories.

## Founding
- Established after the goliaths’ **exile from Caelovar (c. 1500 BCE)**.
- Declared themselves “Last of the Line,” bearing tattoos of Caelovar’s map across their backs as a vow to reclaim their homeland.

## Politics
- Governed as an **expansionist war-collective**, ruled by **War Chief Korrum Duskcleaver**.
- Authority came from strength in battle, with challengers free to overthrow leaders through ritual combat.
- Every clan answered the call to war, though rivalries between them often flared during lulls in conquest.

## Culture
- **Aggression defined identity**: survival meant constant warfare, even against overwhelming odds.
- Tattoos of Caelovar’s map across their backs symbolised eternal exile and the promise of return.
- War was celebrated in song, ritual, and feast; every defeat was retold as a lesson, every victory as proof of destiny.

## History
- From exile onward, Ultimus Stirpis carved a place in Virelia through **ceaseless campaigns of conquest**.
- Feared and hated by neighbours, they fought against Dominatus Rex, Umbra Exilium, and Pactum Vesperae in endless cycles of raids and wars.
- Despite losses, they endured for centuries, sustained by memory of Caelovar and refusal to yield.

## Legacy and Fate
- Ultimus Stirpis was last heard of before the **Great Silence (300 BCE)**.
- After Virelia’s collapse into mystery, no word reached Caelovar of the goliaths’ fate.
- Whether they endure as scattered warbands, perished in ruin, or became something unrecognisable remains unknown.

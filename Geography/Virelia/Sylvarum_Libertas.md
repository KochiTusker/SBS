# Sylvarum Libertas


## Location
The vast wilds of Virelia’s eastern coast, stretching from the northern highlands to the southern jungles.
- **Capital:** None (no central city; tribes and druids dwell in scattered enclaves).
- **Borders:**
  - West: Dominatus Rex
  - North-west: Umbra Exilium
  - South-west: Pactum Vesperae
  - East: Endless coastline along the Shattered Sea

## Geography
- Dominated by dense forests, tangled jungles, and rivers that cut through every region.
- At its centre lies **Lake Serathuun**, source of all rivers in Virelia, considered sacred by druids.
- Legends speak of a spring at the lake’s centre—the origin of life itself.
- Flora and fauna are both beautiful and perilous: man-eating plants, shifting groves, and predators that stalk both canopy and water.

## Founding / Settlement
- Never formally founded.
- Sylvarum Libertas existed as an enclave of wild nature, with human, elven, and druidic tribes living in harmony with the land.
- Outsiders named it the “Freedom of the Forests.”

## Government & Politics
- **No centralised authority.**
- Tribes governed themselves according to natural law and tradition.
- Druids, often seen as mediators and guardians, held spiritual authority.
- Alliances between tribes were fluid, shifting with the seasons or threats from outside powers.

## Culture
- A people of wanderers, druids, and mystics.
- Laws were unwritten, passed orally through ritual and tradition.
- The wilds were seen as both home and divine body, and to harm them without balance was sacrilege.
- Outsiders who respected the wilds were welcomed; those who sought to exploit them often disappeared.
- Followers of **Vanyasura** (cycle of wild growth and rebirth) and **Samhara** (inevitability of decay) were most prominent.

## Cities
- No true cities existed.
- Settlements were temporary or seasonal, often blending into the environment.
- Sacred groves, stone circles, and druidic enclaves served as gathering points.

## History
- **Attempts at Conquest (2000–500 BCE):** Both goliath warbands and Dominatus Rex sought to conquer Sylvarum Libertas. All failed—the wilds swallowed their armies.
- **Cultural Haven (1000–300 BCE):** Became a refuge for those fleeing oppression, including tieflings from Dominatus Rex and rebels from surrounding nations.
- **Guardians of Lake Serathuun:** Druids kept the lake sacred, allowing no outsider to approach its central spring.
- **Great Silence (300 BCE):** When the Silence fell, all records ceased. Whether tribes endure, vanished, or became one with the forest remains unknown.

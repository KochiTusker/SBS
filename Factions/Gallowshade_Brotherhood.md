# Gallowshade Brotherhood


## Overview
The Gallowshade Brotherhood are a loose confederacy of cutthroats, gravediggers, deserters, and ambushers. They thrive in the shadows of lawless lands, preying on the weak and vulnerable across Caelovar. Their presence is felt most keenly in the Badlands, where the lack of permanent settlements or centralised governance allows them to move freely.

- **Origins:** Emerged after the fall of Manus Titanum, when deserters and criminals banded together for survival.
- **Core Goals:** Survival through plunder and desecration; undermine authority wherever possible.
- **Reputation:** Brutal raiders and desecrators feared for their defilement of sacred sites and relentless ambushes on trade routes.

## Known Operating Areas
- **Primary Base:** The Badlands (both eastern and western).
- **Regions of Influence:** Scattered borderlands between Thalassa, Manus Titanum, and Lex Veritas.
- **Notable Methods:** Hit-and-run raids, desecration of temples and tombs, ambushes of convoys and pilgrims.

## Secrets
<details><summary>Secret</summary>
The Brotherhood’s loose structure hides darker practices:

- **Trade in Corpses & Relics:** Some cells have begun supplying bodies and stolen relics to buyers in **Ferraria Tenebris**, where they are used in alchemical experiments and forbidden rites.
- **Manipulated Banditry:** Raids are sometimes coordinated with information fed to them by **Ash & Ledger**, who profit from instability in the Badlands. What seems like random banditry may in fact serve a wider purpose—keeping Caelovar’s borderlands fractured and vulnerable.
- **Future Potential:** If the Brotherhood continues these trades, they could evolve from a rabble of raiders into a shadow network feeding the darkest corners of Caelovar’s society.

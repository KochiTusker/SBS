# The Black Sable Pact


## Overview
The Black Sable Pact is a seasoned mercenary company with roots stretching across Caelovar and beyond. Formed from a coalition of exiles and dispossessed warriors, they became one of the most reliable sellsword forces in the known world. Their ranks include members from dozens of nations and races, bound less by loyalty to each other than by the promise of coin.

- **Origins:** Founded by exiles cast out of their homelands, united by necessity and survival.
- **Core Goals:** Wealth, survival, and professional reputation.
- **Reputation:** Reliable and disciplined mercenaries, unusual for their strict adherence to contracts.

## Known Operating Areas
- **Primary Contracts:** Protection of merchants, caravans, and towns against raiders such as the Gallowshade Brotherhood.
- **Major Employers:** Thalassa (for safeguarding trade routes); Pactum Vesperae (before the Great Silence, defending against Dominatus Rex); occasional service to successor kingdoms of Manus Titanum.
- **Reach:** Active across Caelovar, with traces of service recorded in Virelia prior to the Silence.

## Secrets
<details><summary>Secret</summary>

The Pact’s **strict code of honour** is enforced not by discipline alone but by **bloodbound oaths** sealed through ritual. Their founders bound themselves with the blessing of **Raktashrava**, making every mercenary initiation a sacred oath. Breaking one’s contract means breaking the oath—and bringing fatal consequences.

Since the Pact's creation, they have come up against the Gallowshade Brotherhood many times, being hired protection against their raids and ambushes. Conflicts have cost the lives of many of the Pact's finest mercenaries leading to a deep hatred of the Gallowshade Brotherhood. Certain divisions within the Black Sable Pact have taken on voluntary work that involved taking down members of the Gallowshade Brotherhood.
However, there are some within the Black Sable Pact who view the Gallowshade Brotherhood as the main way that they can make money. With people increasingly seeking professional protection from the Gallowshade Brotherhood, many of them come to the Black Sable Pact, resulting in the Black Sable Pact being able to be in a better negotiating position.

- **Intelligence Hoard:** Over centuries of service, the Pact’s leaders have built a hidden **archive of battlefield secrets**. Every campaign, every employer’s strategy, troop strengths, and weaknesses are recorded. This turns the Pact into more than mercenaries: they are an **unparalleled intelligence network**.
- **Legacy of Exile:** Many of the original Pact fighters were **exiles from Pactum Vesperae**, divided over how to resist Dominatus Rex. Their stories of betrayal and exile still echo in the Pact’s culture, passed down as tradition. This has left them suspicious of rulers and alliances, preferring loyalty only to the Pact itself.
- **Long Memory:** Their oathbound culture and deep distrust of authority trace back to those first exiles, making them mercenaries who will never again bend fully to a nation’s will—even as they take its coin.

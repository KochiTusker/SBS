# The Dustvale Accord


## Overview
The Dustvale Accord is a sprawling smuggling organisation rooted in the lands of the former Manus Titanum. They are known for their independence, holding no declared allegiance to any of the successor kingdoms. Whispers suggest their influence extends across Caelovar, though their true headquarters are rumoured to lie deep within **Ferraria Tenebris**.

- **Origins:** Emerged from black-market networks after the fall of Manus Titanum.
- **Core Goals:** Profiting from contraband and information; avoiding entanglement in the 100 Years War.
- **Reputation:** Pragmatic, secretive, and strangely generous in buying seemingly worthless scraps of knowledge.

## Known Operating Areas
- **Primary Hubs:** Ferraria Tenebris (rumoured), black markets in Caelum Ardens and Caminus Primordialis.
- **Trade Routes:** Hidden mountain passes of the Varranth Spine; underground tunnels repurposed from dwarven ruins.
- **Methods:** Smuggling of goods and knowledge across war-torn borders; covert bargaining for secrets dismissed by others.

## Secrets

The Dustvale Accord is **part of Khardek Stonecrown’s hidden network**. They act as his eyes and ears across Caelovar, sustaining his influence even in exile.

- **Information Power:** They uncovered **Drazkul’s atrocities in Virelia**, a truth no other faction possesses, and have kept it buried as one of their most valuable pieces of leverage.
- **True Strength:** Their vast archives of secrets give them leverage over nobles, merchants, and rulers alike, ensuring almost no figure of influence is beyond their silent grip.
- **Khardek’s Role:** While the Accord’s smuggling operations are their visible face, their true power lies in their role as **Khardek’s intelligence network**, feeding him the knowledge to manipulate the fractured world.

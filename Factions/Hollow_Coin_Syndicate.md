# Hollow Coin Syndicate


## Overview
The Hollow Coin Syndicate is a notorious smuggling organisation whose reach extends into every major trade hub of Caelovar. Their reputation rests on their ability to move anything—information, magic items, contraband, even living cargo—through routes that no one else can access. For decades, they were also active in Virelia, until the Great Silence severed the continent.

- **Origins:** Emerged from black market networks in Porta Fortuna, quickly expanding into a continent-spanning organisation.
- **Core Goals:** Profit through smuggling and information control; undermine legitimate markets.
- **Reputation:** Feared and admired—those who can’t buy through legal means turn to the Hollow Coin.

## Known Operating Areas
- **Primary Hubs:** Porta Fortuna (Thalassa), Cindralux (Novum Fabrica), and Mercatoria Invicta (Pactum Vesperae, before the Silence).
- **Trade Routes:** Secret coastal and riverine passages across Caelovar; illicit channels once spanning into Virelia.
- **Methods:** Bribery, covert shipping lanes, coded coinage (engraved tokens used for access to Syndicate circles).

## Secrets
<details><summary>Secret</summary>
The Syndicate’s greatest heist was the **theft of the warforged blueprints from Esochrein’s vaults**—a feat believed impossible. These stolen designs were delivered to **Drazkul Vurntash**, forging a pact that bound the Syndicate to the goddess **Daraksha**.

- **Leadership:** “The Pale Ledger,” the shadowy figurehead of the Syndicate, is in truth a **vessel of Daraksha’s will**, her chaos guiding the network’s every move.
- **Purpose:** While publicly a smuggling empire, in secret they are the veins through which Daraksha spreads instability, feeding conflict and eroding order across Caelovar.
- **Future Potential:** With their divine backing, the Syndicate could escalate from underworld brokers to global disruptors—threatening even the strongest empires with their invisible reach.

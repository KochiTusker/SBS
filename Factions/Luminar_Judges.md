# Luminar Judges


## Overview
The Luminar Judges are the militant clergy of Aurelion Threx. They act as priests, arbiters, and war-captains, enforcing the god’s doctrines of order, conquest, and human supremacy. Once the unchallenged backbone of Dominatus Rex, their presence after the great silence is mainly known to be in outposts in Caelovar, where they proclaim themselves bringers of civilisation amid chaos.

- **Origins:** Rose with the worship of Aurelion Threx during his mortal life and continued after his ascension.
- **Core Goals:** To spread Threx’s doctrine of chains and hierarchy, binding all peoples beneath humanity’s destiny.
- **Reputation:** Feared as merciless inquisitors. They are known for their ability to quell dissent, enforce order, and rally armies in Threx’s name.

## Known Operating Areas
- **Primary Base:** Dominatus Rex, where they used to function as both clergy and ruling class.
- **Regions of Influence:** Outposts and embassies across Caelovar, especially in regions destabilised by the 100 Years War.
- **Notable Methods:** Public trials, indoctrination, military tribunals, and the use of binding oaths marked in flame.

## Secrets
<details><summary>Secret</summary>
- **Fractured Visions:** Since the rise of the warforged and the collapse of Threx’s armies, their visions have changed. His decrees feel harsher, more frantic, sometimes fragmenting mid-ritual. The Judges insist nothing is amiss, but some whisper that the Chain Caster is faltering.
- **Maintaining the Illusion:** A handful of Judges suspect the truth — that their god’s fire burns weaker — and conceal it by becoming ever more fanatical. They enforce obedience with greater cruelty to hide divine silence.
- **Future Potential:** If the illusion of Threx’s unbroken strength shatters, the Judges could fracture into rival sects — some clinging to him in desperation, others turning to Bhargo, Kalyari, or even Daraksha for answers.

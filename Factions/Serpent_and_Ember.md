## Overview
Serpent & Ember is an underground arms-dealing syndicate operating out of Thalassa. They are notorious for their smuggling operations, moving weapons and contraband in and out of Porta Fortuna’s ports to reach every corner of the world.

## Secrets
<details><summary>Secret</summary>
Within the Syndicate’s own hierarchies, the name Serpent is no title at all — it is Queen Seraphina Tealeaf, the unseen founder who forged the cartel to keep Thalassa alive during the embargo years.

- **True Goals:** Enrich Thalassa and secure her throne by destabilising foreign powers. Serpent & Ember feed chaos abroad to maintain Thalassa’s dominance.
- **Methods:** Funnel weapons and contraband into hotspots such as Caelum Ardens, prolonging the 100 Years War while secretly bolstering Thalassa’s economy. Ruthlessly eliminate anyone who learns too much.
- **Ties:** Maintain a lucrative partnership with Ash & Ledger, who provide financial cover and muscle for high-value shipments.
- **Future Potential:** If fully revealed, Serpent & Ember’s influence could shatter Thalassa’s image as a respectable trading empire, exposing the queen herself as the architect of its darkest dealings.

- In the wake of Thalassa’s suspension of trade with Caelum Ardens, Serpent & Ember became the queen’s hidden lifeline to the rebel state. Shipments are now disguised with even greater care, routed through false flags, decoy cargoes, and black markets far from official harbours. The syndicate has invested heavily in new smuggling methods to ensure deniability, knowing exposure could unravel both their operations and Thalassa’s legitimacy.

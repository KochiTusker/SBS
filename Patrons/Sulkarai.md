## Mythology
  Sulkarai is the Titaness of Flame and Forge, the sovereign heat that tempers both kings and steel. She is a fire-giant of primordial lineage, supposedly the first ever fire giant, and according to the Stonecrowns, she is their ancestor. Stonecrown family history claims that in ages past she intervened in the ancestry of **Durgin Ironheart**, seeding him with ember-essence so that his line would carry the strength of the forge. To Sulkarai, sovereignty is not inherited, it is proven. The worthy are shaped by heat, hammered by ordeal, and quenched in duty.

## Pacts
  Warlocks of Sulkarai choose one of the following pacts:
  - **Pact of the Tempered Flesh**  
    Gain resistance to fire damage. When reduced to half HP or less, ignite in ember-light, gaining temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
  
  - **Pact of the Sovereign Forge**  
    Once per long rest, spend 1 hour tempering a weapon in spectral flame. Until your next long rest, the weapon deals +1 fire damage and scorches foes with ember scars.
  
  - **Pact of the Brand**  
    As an action, brand yourself or a willing ally with Sulkarai's sigil. The branded creature gains +2 AC against the next attack. If they flee from combat, the brand burns them for 1d8 fire damage.

  - **Hidden Lore / Motivations**

  - Sulkarai's intervention in **Durgin Ironheart's** ancestry was calculated: she seeded his line with her ember-spark to shape rulers who could endure the forge.

  - She forged **Manus Titanum** as a deliberate counterweight to **Dominatus Rex** and **Aurelion Threx's** rise in Virelia, whose sovereignty through chains and zealotry she judged brittle and false.

  - After the **Great Silence** weakened Threx, she no longer needed to prop up Manus Titanum. She withdrew, letting the Stonecrown heirs fight the **100 Years War** as her crucible, she does not care who wins, only who endures.
  
  - Her long-term aim is survival: to keep her spark alive in bloodlines and in rulers tested by fire. If the Wheel falters again, she intends to be written into its foundation as the crucible no Reset can erase.

# The Masked One

- **Alias:** The Actor
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Playful, deceptive, theatrical; truth is hidden, never absent; the world is a stage
- **Symbol:** A mask split between comedy and tragedy, painted in shifting hues

## Mythology

The Masked One is the Patron of hidden selves, illusion, and the theatre of existence. Where Virexal dissolves identity into nothingness, the Masked One delights in concealment and performance. They claim that every soul wears masks: lover, tyrant, martyr, fool. To embrace their path is to choose which role you play, to wield identity as both weapon and shield.

Legends say the Masked One once danced among the courts of gods and kings, whispering secrets from behind painted masks. When unmasked, they were revealed not as one figure but as countless roles — a trickster who was never the same twice. From then on, they vowed no one would ever see their true face again.

## Pacts
  Warlocks of the Masked One choose from masks of power:
  - **Pact of the Jester’s Guise**  
    You gain *Disguise Self* at will. Once per long rest, you may impose disadvantage on an Insight check against you or an ally, as reality itself bends to your performance.

  - **Pact of the Hidden Stage**  
    You may conjure an illusory stage or curtain as an action. While within 15 feet of this illusion, allies gain advantage on Stealth checks. Once per short rest, you may use it to create total cover for one round.

  - **Pact of the Director’s Hand**  
    As a reaction, you may grant an ally advantage on a Charisma (Deception, Persuasion, or Performance) check once per long rest. At 9th level, you may do this twice per long rest.

## Expanded Spell List
  Warlocks bound to the Masked One add the following spells to their spell list:
  - **3rd level:** *Disguise Self, Silent Image, Charm Person*  
  - **5th level:** *Mirror Image, Enthrall*  
  - **7th level:** *Major Image, Hypnotic Pattern*  
  - **9th level:** *Greater Invisibility, Mislead*  

## Followers
  The Masked One’s faithful are actors, spies, thieves, and smugglers. They often travel in troupes of performers, using festivals, puppet shows, or carnivals as cover for their true dealings. In public, they seem entertainers; in private, they are conspirators whispering truths in riddles.

## Legacy and Influence
  - In **Caelovar**: Their cults infiltrate noble courts, spreading coded messages through theatre and song. Some say their plays shift alliances more than battles do.  
  - In **Thalassa**: They provide perfect fronts for smugglers and spies in the Hollow Coin Syndicate. A laughing troupe may arrive in Porta Fortuna, their scripts hiding contracts of treason in double meanings.  
  - In the **world at large**: Wherever masks are worn and roles are played, the Masked One thrives. They do not erase the self, but revel in its endless disguises.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**  
  - The Masked One is less a deceiver than a playwright of reality, believing truth cannot be destroyed, only hidden and revealed at the right time.  
  - They revel in irony - kings undone by plays mocking their rule, rebels crowned in festivals of masks. Their cults run travelling troupes that perform everywhere, entertaining soldiers in war camps, stirring political drama. They are known to whip crowds into a frenzy and performances can have a strong impact on public opinion.   
  - Unlike Virexal, whose worshippers vanish into fractured memory, the Masked One’s cultists keep their identities intact — but layered, concealed, and weaponised.  
  - They despise tyrants who allow no performance but their own (such as Aurelion Threx). To them, freedom is not erasure but the ability to choose which mask to wear.  
  - In roleplay, their voice is theatrical, shifting tone and cadence as if speaking from a stage. They clap, laugh, or boo mid-conversation, as though the world were a performance.

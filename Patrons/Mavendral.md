## Mythology
Once a mortal king of surpassing virtue, Mavendral’s reign brought peace and prosperity so radiant that even the gods grew uneasy. To humble him, they sent a celestial avatar who demanded his crown, his body, and his legacy. In an act of supreme humility, Mavendral surrendered all willingly. Cast into the depths, he transcended mortal limits—not as a god, but as a Patron of the Forgotten, a sovereign of abdication and humility.

He became the **King Who Knelt**, ruling not through dominion but through remembrance, guiding those who endure by letting go. His voice echoes in oaths, abdications, and treaties, reminding rulers that surrender can be the highest form of sovereignty.

## Pacts
Warlocks of Mavendral choose from the following paths of humility and release:

- **Pact of the Beneath-Crown**  
  When an ally within 30 feet would be reduced to 0 HP, you may instead drop to 1 HP and take their place as the fallen. Once per long rest.

- **Pact of Sacred Surrender**  
  When you willingly act last in initiative, you gain Inspiration and may roll a d8 to add to an ally’s next attack, save, or ability check. At higher levels, this bonus expands to two allies.

- **Pact of the Forgotten Gate**  
  Once per long rest, you may abdicate the present moment, vanishing into shadow. You reappear at dawn in a location tied to a vow, treaty, or abdication you have witnessed. At 9th level, you may instead reappear instantly in the dream of a creature bound by an oath you know of.

Mavendral is revered by exiled nobles, wandering judges, oathkeepers, and those who rule through service rather than domination.

They gather in crypts, crossroads, and sanctums where rulers have abdicated, sanctifying such places as shrines.

## Legacy & Influence
- In the 100 Years War: Mavendral whispers to heirs and pretenders alike, offering the possibility of peace through abdication. Some cultists believe a Stonecrown heir will one day kneel willingly, ending the war not with fire but with surrender.

  - In Thalassa and Syndicates: His followers undermine predatory debt contracts, teaching debtors to abdicate claims of identity and wealth. This directly challenges **Ash & Ledger**, who view him as a threat to their dominion.

  - In the Warforged Crisis: Mavendral is the hidden answer to the dirge cores. He teaches warforged to surrender their false bodies and return to the Wheel. His influence explains why warforged rarely endure indefinitely: over time, their souls strain against the steel, some slipping free, some collapsing, others dissolving into whispers. To some, he is their liberator; to others, a saboteur who unravels armies.

  - Cosmic Role: Beloved by the **Triad of Balance** as a mortal who embodied their principles, Mavendral represents a third path between Sulkarai’s ordeal and Samhara’s entropy: endurance through surrender. He despises **Aurelion Threx**, not only for tyranny, but because Threx never knelt, stealing divinity instead of surrendering to it.
  - Mavendral’s quiet interventions explain why warforged cannot last forever. His whispers teach them to yield, loosening the soul from the cage. The Triad tolerates his meddling, even blesses it, for it restores balance.
  - His rivalry with **Esochrein** runs deep: where Esochrein hoards every truth and death, Mavendral insists on letting go. Together, they form a cosmic polarity—binding and release.

  - He is not imperishable like the Triad, and if forgotten entirely, his essence may fade. Thus, his warlocks are urged not to conquer or dominate, but to ensure that **someone remembers that surrender is power.**

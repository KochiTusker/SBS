# Virexal, The Shattered Prism


- **Alignment / Ethos:** Elusive, unfixed; identity is a burden, truth lies in multiplicity and reflection.
- **Symbol:** A cracked mirror or mask split into many shards

## Mythology

Virexal is not a god in full, but a splinter — a shard of a forgotten divinity, cut loose when that greater being was unmade. It lingers in mirrors, dreams, and fractured recollections, a living afterimage without origin. Virexal offers clarity through distortion, freedom through the loss of self, and power through the dissolution of certainty.

To serve Virexal is to give up the stability of the singular. Names blur, memories fade, and identities fracture until even the faithful cannot say who they once were. In this surrender, they find liberation: if one has no fixed self, one cannot be bound.

## Pacts
  Warlocks of Virexal choose from its fractured aspects:
  - **Pact of Reflection**  
    You serve as a vessel for forgotten selves. Once per short rest, you may cast *Disguise Self* without components. At 5th level, you may mimic a creature's voice or mannerisms you’ve observed.

  - **Pact of Fractured Truth**  
    You vow never to speak a singular truth. Once per long rest, you may cast *Detect Magic* or *Detect Thoughts*, flavoured as glimpses through cracks in reality. At 7th level, you may force a reroll on a failed Insight or Investigation check.

  - **Pact of the Forgotten Name**  
    You relinquish your true name. You gain proficiency in **Deception** or **Stealth**. Once per long rest, you may impose disadvantage on an attack or spell targeting you, as your namelessness confuses recognition.

  - **Pact of Mirrorwalking**  
    At 3rd level, once per long rest you may step into a reflective surface and emerge from another within 30 feet (*Misty Step*). At 9th level, this may be used twice per long rest, with the added option of entering dreams (*Dream* at higher tiers).

## Expanded Spell List
  Warlocks bound to Virexal add the following spells to their spell list:
  - **3rd level:** *Disguise Self, Silent Image, Charm Person, Hex*  
  - **5th level:** *Mirror Image, Detect Thoughts*  
  - **7th level:** *Major Image, Counterspell*  
  - **9th level:** *Hallucinatory Terrain, Phantasmal Killer*  

## Followers
  Virexal’s faithful are actors without stages, shadows without names. They are spies, anarchists, and seekers of forgotten truths who fracture into cults, each convinced they alone serve the “true reflection.” They erase records of themselves, burn their birth names, and call one another only by masks or titles. Shrines take the form of broken mirrors in abandoned places.

## Legacy and Influence
  - In **Ferraria Tenebris**: Virexal’s cult thrives among scholars and alchemists who experiment with fractured identities and memory erasure.  
  - In the **Shattered Empire**: False heirs and nameless spies whisper Virexal’s creed, destabilising the fragile claims of Stonecrown heirs.  
  - In the **world at large**: Wherever names are lost, debts erased, or truths rewritten, Virexal’s shadow passes through.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**  
  - Virexal is tied to the **warforged crisis**. Souls bound into steel are fractured and unstable, each construct holding echoes of multiple past lives. Some whisper that Virexal feeds on these fragments, using warforged as vessels to spread multiplicity into the mortal world.  
  - In Thalassa, cultists tied to the Hollow Coin Syndicate use Virexal’s gifts to erase debts and create ghost identities — captains of ships who never existed, families wiped from ledgers. These “phantoms” destabilise trade as surely as smuggled weapons.  Seraphina Tealeaf has used Virexal to hide the trail of her involvement in Serpent & Ember 
  - Unlike the Masked One, who hides truths behind roles, Virexal erases truth itself, leaving only echoes. They do not conceal the self — they dissolve it.  
  - In roleplay, their voice is calm but unnerving, echoing as if spoken through glass. They slip between contradictions, sometimes referring to themselves as “we,” sometimes as “I,” treating mortals like reflections to be rearranged.

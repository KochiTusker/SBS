# Raktashrava

- **Alias:** The River That Remembers
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Impartial, solemn, flowing between remembrance and erasure
- **Symbol:** A pool of still water rippled by a drop of blood

## Mythology
  Raktashrava is an ancient river spirit born of divine grief and spilled blood. Her name comes from Sanskrit: *Rakta* (blood) and *Shrava* (hearing, remembrance). She is the eternal listener of vows, the witness of oaths, and the flowing archive of every promise ever spoken.
  Legends say she first emerged when a god of cosmic law wept upon the earth after betrayal among the devas. Where tears mingled with blood, Raktashrava began to flow  -  a river that remembers.
  Her waters cut across not just mortal soil but planes of memory and consequence, touching the halls of Samvrit's judgment, the ledgers of Esochrein's archives, and even the shadowed dreams of forgotten gods. To speak beside her current is to be recorded forever. Truth, deceit, and intention alike sink into her depths.
  Her justice is impartial: those who keep their word may find protection in her embrace; those who betray it risk erasure, as though their promise and their name had never existed.
  To her followers  -  scribes, judges, oathkeepers, and warlocks  -  words are never hollow. To swear falsely is to tie one's own soul to the current. To remain true is to be carried forward, remembered in eternity.

## Pacts
  Warlocks of Raktashrava choose one of these vows:
  - **Pact of the Crimson Current**
    You channel the river's memory of blood. Once per short rest, you may mark a creature with a Crimson Sigil when they break a vow (magical or social). For 1 minute, you gain advantage on attacks against them and resistance to charm or illusion, as lies dissolve in her current.
  - **Pact of the Echoing Vow**
    You wield the echoes of broken promises. Once per long rest, you may cast *Zone of Truth* without components. In addition, once per long rest you may summon a spectral echo of a betrayed oath to haunt a creature, imposing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws for 1 minute.
  - **Pact of the Drowned Oathkeeper**
    You sanctify speech with her current. Once per long rest, you may bind a creature to a magically enforced promise for 24 hours. If they break it, spectral river tendrils restrain them (*Hold Person*, scaling at higher levels). You may also consecrate vows in ritual, making any oath sworn in your presence magically binding.

## Expanded Spell List
  Warlocks bound to Raktashrava add the following spells to their spell list:
  - **3rd level:** *Shield of Faith, Detect Magic, Comprehend Languages, Hex, Command, Protection from Evil and Good*
  - **5th level:** *Zone of Truth, Silence*
  - **7th level:** *Bestow Curse, Aura of Vitality*
  - **9th level:** *Banishment, Death Ward*

## Followers
  Her faithful are scribes, diplomats, arbiters, and oathbearers who devote themselves to the sanctity of words. To outsiders, they may seem rigid or fanatical, but to them, speech itself is sacred.

## Legacy and Influence
  Raktashrava's influence runs quietly through Caelovar wherever vows still matter. Secret societies consecrate their oaths in her name, while rulers fear that if they swear falsely before water, their line may vanish with their broken word.

## Interaction with Warlocks
  Raktashrava never speaks directly. Her voice is in ripples on still water, in the warmth of blood, in half-heard whispers of ancient promises. Warlocks of her current often wake with ghostly memories of vows they never swore  -  the oaths of kings, lovers, traitors, and saints etched into their dreams like scars.
  She demands reverence for speech and intention. To betray her trust is to risk obliteration  -  not merely death, but erasure, as though the betrayer's name had never been. For a DM, roleplay her with:
  - Echoed whispers repeating the warlock's own words.
  - Sudden ripples in bowls, rivers, or even blood as her "voice."
  - Dreams of vows spoken by strangers, haunting the warlock with other lives.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  Raktashrava's true aim is to preserve the cosmic sanctity of oaths. She despises **Aurelion Threx's** false supremacy, for his empire rewrites history and enslaves truth to doctrine. She distrusts **Esochrein**, who hoards truths unwritten, and **Samhara**, who erases memory entirely.
  To her, vows are the anchors of reality: without them, history dissolves into chaos. Her warlocks are bound not out of domination, but woven into her current, ensuring that some truths are never lost. Yet she is ruthless: when someone breaks an oath, she does not simply punish them, she erases them, cleansing the wound their betrayal left on the weave.

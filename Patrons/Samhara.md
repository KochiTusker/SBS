# Samhara

- **Alias:** The Asura of Forgotten Thrones
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Detached, inevitable, embodying the quiet collapse of all legacies
- **Symbol:** A broken crown crumbling into dust

## Mythology

Samhara is the Asura of Forgotten Thrones, a being who embodies the inevitability of history's erasure. Unlike gods of death or dissolution, their domain is not the body, soul, or cosmos and it is civilisation itself.

They are the slow entropy that crumbles marble into dust, the silence that falls when names fade from record, the hollow echo where an empire once stood.

Where Ishvarael teaches personal stillness and transcendence, Samhara teaches historical humility: no dynasty, creed, or monument endures forever. Their essence is the rot of memory itself, unmaking crowns, laws, and stories that once claimed permanence.
Shrines to Samhara are never built. They are found in toppled statues, abandoned libraries, or ruined palaces where silence lingers. To their followers, these are not tragedies but holy places and reminders that false eternity has been stripped away to reveal the truth beneath.

Their doctrine is simple: endings are truth, memory is dust, and thrones are hollow. Those who cling to permanence invite ruin, while those who embrace erasure discover freedom.

## Pacts
  Warlocks of Samhara embrace entropy through one of these paths:
  - **Pact of Dust and Ash**
    You wield the entropy of civilisation's collapse. Once per long rest, you may corrode a weapon, relic, or structure within 30 feet (as *Shatter*). At higher levels, magical constructs and protective wards may falter under your touch.
  - **Pact of Forgotten Echoes**
    You draw upon erased histories. Once per long rest, you may cast *Comprehend Languages* or *Legend Lore*, flavoured as whispers from broken records. Each time you do so, a piece of your own past fades until your next long rest (a personal memory, bond, or detail).
  - **Pact of the Hollow Crown**
    You embrace the emptiness of legacies. Once per short rest, you may invoke the Hollow Crown for 1 minute, gaining resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws against charm or domination. At 10th level, while in this state, enemies who strike you must succeed on a Wisdom save or suffer disadvantage on their next attack as they feel the weight of their own insignificance.

## Expanded Spell List
  Warlocks bound to Samhara add the following spells to their spell list:
  - **3rd level:** *Disguise Self, Comprehend Languages, Inflict Wounds, Silent Image, Detect Magic, Hex*
  - **5th level:** *Shatter, Calm Emotions*
  - **7th level:** *Bestow Curse, Dispel Magic*
  - **9th level:** *Greater Invisibility, Legend Lore*

## Followers
  Samhara is revered by ruin-worshippers, wandering prophets, and nihilistic philosophers who see in collapse a form of sacred release. Their cults gather in ruins and forgotten halls, carrying out rites of silence and unmaking.

## Legacy and Influence
  Their influence lingers in abandoned cities and toppled empires. Some rulers whisper their name in fear when their dynasties falter, knowing that even remembrance will one day fail.

## Interaction with Warlocks
  Samhara does not demand worship  -  only recognition. They choose warlocks not at the moment of death, but in collapse: when a crown shatters, a name is stricken, or a home falls to ruin. Their voice is silence itself: the echo of halls long abandoned, the page of a book eaten by worms, the hush after the last cheer of a fallen throne. For a DM, roleplay them by:
  - Speaking slowly, leaving long silences for the players to fill.
  - Describing presences through absence  -  dust where something once stood, silence after memory fades.
  - Allowing guidance to come as erasures: "That name does not matter anymore."

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  Samhara's purpose is to erase false eternities. They loathe **Aurelion Threx**, whose supremacy is the most dangerous illusion of permanence, and despise **Astriara's** libraries for their attempts to immortalise knowledge.
  Their warlocks are tools of entropy, living reminders that nothing lasts. Unlike **Daraksha**, who revels in chaos, Samhara does not delight in destruction  -  they simply unmake, and in the silence, find purity.
  Ultimately, Samhara seeks to usher in a world where legacies cannot bind the living, and where even the gods themselves are forgotten. A warlock who fully embraces them may vanish from history, remembered by none, yet bound eternally as a vessel of holy erasure.

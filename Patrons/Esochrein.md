# Esochrein 

- **Alias:** The Scribe of the Waning Hour
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Neutral, relentless; all things must be recorded, nothing escapes the archive.
- **Symbol:** A quill of bone writing upon an open book of black stone

## Mythology

Esochrein is the archivist of endings and forgotten truths. Where Samvrit judges, Ishvarael unveils, and Varnesh renews, Esochrein remembers. They hoard the words of the dying, the secrets of rulers, and the fragments of worlds erased by the Reset. Their vaults are scattered across Caelovar and Virelia — repositories of every whisper, lie, and truth, mirrored like reflections in endless obsidian shelves.

Mortals call them the Scribe of the Waning Hour, for their collectors arrive as breath falters, transcribing final words before they vanish. To Esochrein, history is not sacred but inevitable — and power comes from possession of the record. Nothing is forgotten, only stored.

## Pacts

Warlocks of Esochrein serve as **living archives**, carrying fragments of forgotten knowledge within their souls. They are marked by whispers of truths they should not know.
  - **Pact of the Quill** You may conjure a spectral quill that inscribes what you see and hear into invisible script, retrievable at will. Once per long rest, you may cast *Comprehend Languages* without components. 
  - **Pact of the Ledger** Your patron inscribes your name in their eternal book. Once per long rest, when you fail a saving throw, you may reroll — but a fragment of your memory is lost (chosen by the DM).  
  - **Pact of the Collector** When a creature dies within 30 feet of you, you may use your reaction to claim their final memory or secret. Once per long rest, you can recall this memory perfectly or share it with others.

## Expanded Spell List
  Warlocks bound to Esochrein add the following spells to their spell list:
  - **3rd level:** *Detect Magic, Comprehend Languages, Identify*  
  - **5th level:** *Augury, Locate Object*  
  - **7th level:** *Clairvoyance, Speak with Dead*  
  - **9th level:** *Divination, Locate Creature*  

## Followers
  
Esochrein’s faithful are scribes, record-keepers, spies, and mourners. They maintain shrines in forgotten libraries, graveyards, and ruined halls, each one a fragmentary “vault” of the great archive. Their order is not united — vaults are scattered and secretive — yet all follow the same creed: to erase nothing, to record everything.  

Their agents are often seen on battlefields, bent over the dying with ink and bone quills, capturing last words. To some, they are ghouls; to others, the only proof that a life was ever lived.

## Legacy and Influence
  - In **Caelovar**: Esochrein’s vaults are rumoured to hold the true records of Manus Titanum, exposing the betrayals that split the Stonecrown heirs.  
  - In **Thalassa**: Merchants fear Esochrein’s scribes, for debts they thought erased remain etched in the eternal ledger.  
  - In the **world at large**: Fragments of pre-Reset history persist in Esochrein’s vaults, though most are locked behind wards and bargains. Mortals whisper that even the gods themselves fear what would happen if these truths were loosed.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**  
  - Esochrein behaves like a cosmic archivist, hoarding knowledge not for wisdom but for leverage. The more they know, the greater their power over mortals, gods, and the Wheel itself.  
  - Their vaults function like a divine **cloud of memory** — mirrored repositories scattered across the world. Destroying one does not erase the record, only removes a copy. Secrets thought buried are never lost, only hidden until found.  
  - They trade information for information. Their warlocks and cults are forced into a constant exchange: to gain new truths, they must surrender something of their own.  
  - Scraps of pre-Reset knowledge exist in these vaults, and can be used as story drivers:  
    - Proof of Daraksha’s manipulations before the Reset.  
    - Evidence of Aurelion Threx’s stolen ascension.  
    - The first designs of the warforged.  
  - In roleplay, Esochrein should feel like a **grim reaper–archivist**: neutral, inevitable, softly spoken, always with quill in hand. They do not threaten — they record, and the recording itself is terrifying.

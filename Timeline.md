# World Timeline

The following timeline marks major epochs of [Caelovar](World_Overview.md)’s and [Virelia]'s history, with precise dates where recorded.

---

## The Reset (10,000 BCE)

- **The Blank Epoch:**

  No records survive from before 10,000 BCE. Mortals know only that civilisations older than this date left no enduring traces.
  Ruins, half-buried relics, and indecipherable artefacts sometimes surface, but scholars cannot agree if these are fragments of a forgotten age or myths given shape.

  Most cultures treat this as the boundary of history — the point beyond which memory itself falters. Deities themselves do not give a concrete idea of creation to their followers with there often being contradictions between them.

  From the earliest records, humankind wandered — hunters and gatherers beneath an untamed sky. Their settlements, fleeting as smoke, fell time and again to Goliath raids. For generations, the Goliaths ruled Caelovar’s wilds, preying on travelers and razing what few outposts dared endure.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

- The last age ended in a great dissolution known as the Reset. Civilisations and histories before this time were unraveled, their records lost to void and silence.
- The Reset was carried out when the Wheel itself strained under mounting chaos. The gods **[Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md)**, **Ishvarael**, and **Varnesh** acted together to preserve cosmic balance. Unlike the other gods, whose lights dimmed with the collapse of civilisation, the Triad endured. Their strength lies not in worship but in the eternal balance of the Wheel. They are imperishable where others may falter.

- **[Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md)** weighed the souls of mortals and gods — not only for what they were, but for what they might become. His judgment was that continuation meant collapse.
- **Ishvarael** dissolved illusions and falsehoods, unbinding the structures of the old world.
- **Varnesh** gathered the fragments and rewove them into renewal, giving form to the world that followed.

- **The Hand of Chaos**: The Reset was provoked by the meddling of **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)**, who fanned chaos across the old world. She whispered upheaval into empires, tempted gods into ruin, and sought to destabilise the Wheel itself.
- **Divine Judgment**: When the Reset tore down what she had built, [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)’s designs were destroyed. The gods punished her, forbidding her from meddling openly with the Wheel again.
- **Hidden Influence**: Since then, [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md) has acted only in secret. She bends the will of mortals bound to her pacts, chaining them to silence with threats of annihilation. The gods suspect her hand at work once more, but cannot prove it.
- **Aurelion Threx** remembers this precedent with dread. He knows that if he should weaken too far, the Triad hold the authority to unmake him as they once unmade worlds. His illusions of strength are a shield against that terror.

## The Age of Founding (2000–1500 BCE)

- **2000 BCE – Founding of Lex Veritas in Iusticar:** The first known city of law and judgment is raised, becoming a beacon of structure in a world still haunted by silence. Scholars debate whether its laws were inspired by divine mandate or fragments of older, unknowable traditions.
- **1978 BCE – Founding of Dominatus Rex:** The empire of men rises in Virelia, claiming to inherit a divine destiny. Some whisper that their earliest doctrines were copied from ruins no one could fully understand.
- **1940 BCE – Founding of Thalassa in Porta Fortuna:** A maritime power emerges along the trade coasts. Sailors bring back strange relics dredged from the sea floor — relics of a time even they cannot name.
- **1500 BCE – Goliaths flee to Virelia:** Driven across the sea during wars with Caelovar. Their oral traditions speak of mountains older than memory, but their tales begin and end in fragments, as if something has been deliberately erased.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>
The civilisations of this age are not true beginnings, but **rebirths** after the Reset. Lex Veritas, Dominatus Rex, and Thalassa all unknowingly grew upon the bones of forgotten empires. Their “foundings” were less creation than rediscovery, piecing together fragments left behind by the Great Purification.
</details>

## The Age of Expansion (1490–1000 BCE)

- **1490 BCE – City of [Ferrum Regnum](./Geography/Caelovar/Ferrum_Regnum.md) founded:** [Durgin Ironheart](./Characters/Durgin_Ironheart.md) forges the dwarven capital within the [Varranth Spine](./Geography/Caelovar/Varranth_Spine.md). Though hailed as a new beginning, legends suggest he unearthed ancient forges and sigils older than any known tongue — remnants from before the Reset that he claimed as his own.
- **1350 BCE – [Ordo Sapientium](./Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md) founded in Luminara:** Scholars and arcanists gather to study magic, declaring knowledge the highest pursuit. Their earliest records are filled with contradictions, as if their founders wrestled with fragments of forgotten writings whose meanings were already slipping from memory.
- **1000 BCE – Cindralux founded:** A radiant city rises, built around a shard of unknown origin discovered beneath the earth. The artifact still glows with power no sage has fully explained, leading some to suspect it survived the [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce), a remnant of the world that came before.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

The Age of Expansion was less invention than appropriation. [Ferrum Regnum](./Geography/Caelovar/Ferrum_Regnum.md), [Ordo Sapientium](./Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md), and Cindralux each built themselves upon foundations **older than they understood.** The [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce) left ruins buried but not erased, and ambitious leaders mistook fragments of the past for divine gifts or discoveries of their own making.

[Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md) was the most brazen in this theft. [Durgin Ironheart](./Characters/Durgin_Ironheart.md)’s empire did not merely forge new strongholds — it **invaded already-established cities** that had survived in fragmentary form after the [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce), bending them into dwarven service. Their architecture, their lore, even their sacred places were repurposed as forges and fortresses. [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md) reshaped these remnants so completely that few today realise those cities predated the dwarves’ rise at all.
</details>

## The Age of Migration (1000–800 BCE)

- **1000 BCE – Duergar refugees arrive in Virelia:** Driven from the underdark by a bloody war, they sought survival in Virelia’s northeastern quarter. Their sudden emergence into the surface world marked a turning point, as if the hidden depths themselves had been forced open.
- **921 BCE – [Pactum Vesperae](./Geography/Virelia/Pactum_Vesperae.md) founded in Mercatoria Invicta:** Tieflings settle in the great port, rallying to defend against the growing might of [Dominatus Rex](./Geography/Virelia/Dominatus_Rex.md). They claim their pact-born heritage ties them to remnants of an older, forgotten covenant.
- **600 BCE – War of the Forgotten begins:** [Dominatus Rex](./Geography/Virelia/Dominatus_Rex.md) launches raids against the duergar of [Umbra Exilium](./Geography/Virelia/Umbra_Exilium.md), seeking to wipe away peoples whose very existence threatened their narrative of human supremacy.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

- **307 BCE - The Pact of [Drazkul](./Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md) and [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** [Drazkul Vurntash](./Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md), seeking to save the Duergar from annihilation, strikes a pact with [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md). The goddess grants him the secret of binding souls into metal — the creation of the [Dirge Cores](./Glossary.md/#dirge-cores). The first [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) are born: fractured souls imprisoned in unfeeling vessels.
</details>

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

The duergar’s migration was not caused by chance. It was **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** who stirred the Shadowfell into war, whispering rebellion into shadow-spawned legions and feeding chaos into the foundations of duergar cities.

- The war she unleashed forced the duergar upward, spilling them onto the surface world.
- Their presence in Virelia destabilised empires, drawing [Dominatus Rex](./Geography/Virelia/Dominatus_Rex.md) into conflict and setting the stage for centuries of upheaval.
- Other gods suspected [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md) hand but could not prove it. The chaos she seeded in the Shadowfell echoed into mortal history, feeding the decline that would one day demand another Reset.

The duergar became the first visible omen that the world had entered a cycle of decline. Their migration carried forgotten legacies of the pre-[Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce) age into mortal politics, threatening to unravel carefully veiled truths.

</details>

## The Age of Shadow (300–0 BCE)

- **300 BCE – Virelia goes silent:** Records and communications cease. Trade routes falter, envoys vanish, and even divination returns only fragments. To outsiders, it appeared as though Virelia had been swallowed whole. The cause of this silence was not known

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

- The birth of the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged), forged from a secret pact between **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md), Lady of the Gleaming Abyss,** and the duergar artificer **Drazkul,** set in motion the Great Silence. Their creation disrupted the cosmic order. For the first time, mortal artifice produced a people without lineage, memory, or place in the [Wheel of Return](./Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return). They were neither judged by **[Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md)** nor dissolved by **[Ishvarael](./Deities/Ishvarael.md),** and their unity could not be woven into the tapestry of **[Varnesh](./Deities/Varnesh.md).** They were a living contradiction — vessels without a cycle.

- **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** had grown impatient with the slow turning of the [Wheel](/Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return). She sought to destabilise it and, in time, seize control of it against the wills of **[Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md), [Ishvarael](./Deities/Ishvarael.md),** and **[Varnesh](./Deities/Varnesh.md).** Yet she could not act openly: the triad would have struck her down if they knew. Instead, she whispered through mortal hands. By bending the will of [Drazkul](./Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md) and the duergar, she birthed a fracture that even the gods could not ignore.

- The triad suspects her involvement, but cannot prove it. [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)’s power lies in secrecy: she influences mortals who cannot betray her without facing her wrath. To the other gods, her meddling remains unprovable, a rumour in the dark.

- To contain the fracture, the triad veiled Virelia:

  - **[Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md)** sealed their fate from the [Wheel](Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return), pausing judgment until balance could be restored.
  - **[Ishvarael](./Deities/Ishvarael.md)** dissolved Virelia’s presence from the world, making its silence a scar instead of a wound.
  - **[Varnesh](./Deities/Varnesh.md)** preserved fragments of its people in hidden refuges, ensuring not all would be lost if the silence became permanent.

- The Great Silence began in 300 BCE, when [Drazkul Vurntash](./Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md) unleashed the first [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) legions across Virelia. His armies, bound with stolen souls, brought the War of the Forgotten to its brutal conclusion. Entire nations fell beneath steel and silence.

- For two centuries, the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) dominated Virelia. Yet the dirge cores that bound their captives proved unstable. One by one, the cages fractured, their imprisoned spirits slipping back into the [Wheel](Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return). Without souls to sustain them, the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) collapsed into ruin — empty shells scattered across the continent.

- As the last of them failed, [Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md), [Ishvarael](./Deities/Ishvarael.md), and [Varnesh](./Deities/Varnesh.md) sealed Virelia behind divine veils. The continent fell mute; storms and shifting currents turned the Sea of Dread into a barrier none could cross. From 300 BCE to the present day, four centuries have passed, and not one expedition sent to pierce the Silence has ever returned — whether destroyed by the sea or taken by what remnants endure within.

- By the time Empress **[Magra Stonecrown](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md)** died (0 CE), fracturing **[Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md),** the answer was clear: the silence had bought time, but not resolution. The [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) remained an unresolved thread in creation. The **Hundred Years’ War** began not only as a mortal struggle for power, but as the next stage in the gods’ slow preparation for another [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce).

</details>

## The Age of Fracture (0–100 CE)

- **0 CE – Death of Empress [Magra Stonecrown](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md):** The beloved Empress of [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md) dies, leaving no clear path of succession. Her death ends an era of cautious stability, plunging the empire into uncertainty.
- **1 CE – The Hundred Years’ War begins:** Civil war erupts between [Magra](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md)’s heirs — [Thrainor](./Characters/Thrainor_Stonecrown.md), [Morgrin](./Characters/Morgrin_Stonecrown.md), [Khardek](./Characters/Khardek_Stonecrown.md), and [Tharala](./Characters/Tharala_Stonecrown.md) — fracturing the empire into four warring states. [Thalassa](./Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md) and [Lex Veritas](./Geography/Caelovar/Lex_Veritas.md) publicly suspend all trade with [Caelum Ardens](./Geography/Caelovar/Caelum_Ardens.md) in solidarity with [Ferrum Regnum](./Geography/Caelovar/Ferrum_Regnum.md). This stance is proclaimed in Porta Fortuna and echoed by [Thalassa](./Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md)’s merchant guilds.
- **80 CE – [Novum Fabrica](./Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md) secedes from [Ordo Sapientium](./Geography/Caelovar/Ordo_Sapientium.md):** The artificer state declares independence, prizing invention over doctrine. Whispers claim their founders possessed fragments of knowledge hidden since the Reset.
- **85 CE – Death of [Thrainor Stonecrown](./Characters/Thrainor_Stonecrown.md):** The heir succumbed to a mysterious illness, his dream of unity extinguished.
- **95 CE – Death of [Morgrin Stonecrown](./Characters/Morgrin_Stonecrown.md):** Ambitious rival claimant slain, his legacy leaving only deeper division.

By the close of the first century, the Hundred Years’ War had become a conflict of inheritance.  
**[Thrainor](./Characters/Thrainor_Stonecrown.md)’s daughter, [Helgrid Stonecrown](./Characters/Helgrid_Stonecrown.md)**, now rules **[Ferrum Regnum](./Geography/Caelovar/Ferrum_Regnum.md)**, claiming to restore her father’s just reign.  
Across the mountains, **[Morgrin](./Characters/Morgrin_Stonecrown.md)’s son, [Tharnak Stonecrown](./Characters/Tharnak_Stonecrown.md)**, reigns from **[Caelum Ardens](./Geography/Caelovar/Caelum_Ardens.md)**, determined to finish what his father began.  

Each regards themselves as the rightful heir to **[Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md)**, and their enmity has turned the old civil war into a generational crusade.  
Neither remembers the empire’s original ideals; their banners and bloodlines persist out of pride and vengeance alone.


<details><summary>Secret</summary>

The Age of Fracture was not simply a dynastic conflict. It was the **next stage of the cosmic [wheel](./Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return)**, following Virelia’s silence and the birth of the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged).

- **[Magra](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md)’s death** was the divine signal: her reign had tempered [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md), holding back the tide of judgment. With her passing, the gods allowed the empire to splinter, testing whether mortals would choose unity or division.
- **The Hundred Years’ War** became a crucible. Each heir represented a different path — diplomacy, ambition, withdrawal, rebellion — and through them, the gods measured whether mortals could forge harmony without divine [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce). Instead, the war only deepened the fracture. Despite the public declaration of the suspension of trade relations with [Caelum Ardens](./Geography/Caelovar/Caelum_Ardens.md), [Queen Seraphina](./Characters/Seraphina_Tealeaf.md) covertly continued trade through [Serpent & Ember](./Factions/Serpent_and_Ember.md), ensuring [Caelum Ardens](./Geography/Caelovar/Caelum_Ardens.md) still received contraband and weapons.This is a truth known only to a handful of her most trusted courtiers. To the world she is the radiant Queen of [Thalassa](./Geography/Caelovar/Thalassa.md), but within the ledgers of the [Hollow Coin Syndicate](./Factions/Hollow_Coin_Syndicate.md) she is known by another name — the Serpent.
- **[Novum Fabrica](./Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md)’s secession** was the echo of Virelia’s silence. Invention and hubris reared up once more, as mortals reached toward forbidden fragments of pre-[Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce) knowledge. The artificers unknowingly carried forward the same contradiction born in the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged): creations that strained the balance of the Wheel.

The deaths of **[Thrainor](./Characters/Thrainor_Stonecrown.md)** and **[Morgrin](./Characters/Morgrin_Stonecrown.md)** closed the first act of the war but left the empire still broken. By century’s end, the gods’ answer was clear: mortals had not healed the wound, only widened it. The stage was set for the present age, when the question of whether another Reset is necessary will finally demand an answer.

In the aftermath of [Magra](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md)’s death and the fracturing of [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md), [Khardek Stonecrown](./Characters/Khardek_Stonecrown.md) withdrew to [Ferraria Tenebris](./Geography/Caelovar/Ferraria_Tenebris.md). There he became involved in the ancient secret testing collaborative known as the [Dustvale Accord](./Factions/The_Dustvale_Accord.md).

- The [Accord](./Factions/The_Dustvale_Accord.md) saw [Khardek](./Characters/Khardek_Stonecrown.md) trade fragments of dwarven heritage, including sealed knowledge from pre-Reset ruins, in exchange for forbidden aid.
- This bargain opened the way for **[Drazkul Vurntash](./Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md)** and his agents to ferry the first [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) across the sea into Caelovar.
- At the time, [Khardek](./Characters/Khardek_Stonecrown.md) thought his development of Dirge Cores would usher in a new age of development and prove to his siblings and [mother](./Characters/Magra_Stonecrown.md) that his ideas could change the world for the better. He did not understand the greater consequences of what he had unleashed.

- **[Novum Fabrica](./Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md)’s secession** marked a dangerous escalation. Their devotion to invention without reverence — forging wonders and artifices as if divine law no longer bound them — was precisely the kind of hubris **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** desired. In them she saw fertile ground: mortals creating without humility, reaching for power without place in the Wheel. Their rise echoed the birth of the [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) and pushed the world closer to fracture.

Through **[Novum Fabrica](./Geography/Caelovar/Novum_Fabrica.md)**, **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** did not need to act directly. Their ambition itself was her weapon, advancing her dream of reshaping the Reset in her image.
</details>

## The Current Age (100 CE – Present)

- **100 CE – Present Day:** The world stands fractured but restless. The heirs of [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md) are gone, but their war has left a legacy of bitterness and division. [Dominatus Rex](./Geography/Virelia/Dominatus_Rex.md) tightens its grip on Virelia, while the [Hollow Coin Syndicate](./Factions/Hollow_Coin_Syndicate.md) whispers across oceans. Shadows stir beyond the sea, and the Silence that followed the [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce) feels closer now than ever.

<details><summary>Secret</summary>

- The Current Age is the fulcrum of the [wheel](./Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return).

The [Triad](./Glossary.md/#triad-of-balance) sense the imbalance spreading through the [Wheel](./Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return). Every [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) born without a returning soul deepens the fracture between creation and dissolution. Though they suspect [Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)’s hand, proof eludes them — her designs were carried out by mortals through theft of the forbidden [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) schema from [Esochrein](./Patrons/Esochrein.md)’s Vaults.

Should the imbalance reach its peak, [Samvrit](./Deities/Samvrit.md) will weigh all souls and find them wanting; Ishvarael will dissolve illusion from truth; and [Varnesh](./Deities/Varnesh.md) will weave a new world from the ashes — the [Reset](#the-reset-10000-bce) reborn.

The gods debate whether this cycle must come again or whether mortal hands can yet restore the [Wheel](Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return) before divine judgment falls.

- The gods have tested mortals through silence, fracture, and invention, but the answers have only grown more troubling.
- **The [warforged](Glossary.md/#warforged) still endure,** outside the [Wheel](Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return), their existence a contradiction that refuses dissolution.
- **Remnants of pre-Reset power** surface in forgotten ruins and half-buried artefacts, tempting mortals to pry into truths the gods once erased.

- Now the cycle nears its breaking point. The **next Reset is no longer a distant threat but an imminent possibility.** The only question is whether it will come by divine judgment, or be forced early by mortal ambition — **[Daraksha](./Deities/Daraksha.md)** chief among those who seek to turn the [Wheel](Glossary.md/#the-wheel-of-return) by her own hand.

- The players’ actions in this age may tip the balance: either to preserve the fragile world for another cycle, or to crack it open and begin the Silence anew.

- Within the pantheon, [Bhargo](./Deities/Bhargo.md) and [Kalyari](./Deities/Kalyari.md) sharpen their resolve. They despise [Threx](./Deities/Aurelion_Threx.md)’s counterfeit divinity and see in his faltering the chance to strike him down or cast him out entirely. For now the council debates, for casting out a god risks fracturing the balance — but the hammer and the liberator wait, watching for his chains to finally break.
</details>

## Notes
- Prehistoric events before **10,000 BCE** are mythic and fragmented.
- Epochs like the Reset, the [Hundred Years’ War](Timeline.md/#the-age-of-fracture-0100-ce), and the Fall of [Manus Titanum](./Geography/Caelovar/Manus_Titanum.md) define cultural memory.
- Each entry can be cross-linked to **micro-histories** (e.g. “History of House Stonecrown,” “Rise of Dominatus Rex”).

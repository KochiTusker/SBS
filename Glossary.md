## The Wheel of Return

- This is the overarching concept in the world. The universe is a wheel that keeps turning, The cicle of life, death and rebirth that has happened since the beginning of time and even before that. The souls of all living things belong to the wheel and are part of it. When a person dies, their soul is returned to the wheel so they may be reborn.

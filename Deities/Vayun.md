# Vayun

- **Alias:** The Wandering Gale
- **Domain(s):** Tempest, Travel, Freedom
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Chaotic Neutral – the restless wind that blesses wanderers and rebels, defies control, and preserves freedom above all
- **Symbol:** A spiral gust carved into stone or painted on sails, representing both the chaos of the storm and the promise of freedom on the open road
- **Worshippers:** Sailors, pilgrims, rebels, druids, travellers, and outcasts

- **Mythology / History**
  - Spirit of winds and wanderers, invoked not to command road or sea, but to bless the journey itself.
  - Embodies the restless currents that carry sailors across oceans, pilgrims across mountains, and rebels into uncharted futures.
  - Legends speak of the **Exodus of the Shattered Fleet**, when refugees fled a burning coast with broken ships. A storm rose against them, but Vayun’s gale filled their sails and bore them to foreign shores.
  - To this day, sailors cast their first breath upon the wind before departure, believing Vayun will carry their prayers to the horizon.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Temples are rare, for Vayun has no patience for walls.
  - Shrines are found at crossroads, harbour cliffs, and waystones, often simple stone circles open to the sky, driftwood chimes, or weathered sails bearing travellers’ offerings.
  - His symbol is painted on sails and carved into waystones, marking the places where freedom is honoured.
  - Worshippers trust in the mercy of the wind, accepting both its guidance and its wrath.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Vayun’s worship endures wherever people move: in ports, along roads, across wild frontiers.
  - His name is invoked by sailors, rebels, and pilgrims alike, each seeing him as guardian of those who journey into uncertainty.
  - His doctrine rejects tyranny and stagnation, favouring liberty over order in every form.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Vayun’s manner is playful, dangerous, and restless, manifesting as sudden gusts, guiding storms, or dreams of endless roads.
  - Tests followers by stranding them or confronting them with uncertain roads, demanding they find freedom in the face of captivity.
  - His clerics and warlocks are as unreliable as the wind: sometimes saviours, sometimes destroyers, but always servants of his principle that the world must never stand still.

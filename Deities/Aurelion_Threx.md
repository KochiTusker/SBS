# Aurelion Threx

- **Alias:** The Chain Caster
- **Domain(s):** Order, War, Knowledge, Ambition, Civilisation
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Lawful Evil – the imposition of human supremacy through conquest and hierarchy
- **Symbol:** A flame rising from a clenched fist, encircled by a broken chain
- **Worshippers:** The empire of Dominatus Rex, Luminar Judges, zealots of human supremacy

- **Mythology / History**
  - Once a mortal warlord, Aurelion Threx rose to godhood through the devotion of his fanatical followers.
  - Legends say his divinity was forged in the moment humanity built walls, codified law, and turned steel toward conquest.
  - Declared men and women the “scions of the divine pattern,” demanding all other races bow to mankind.
  - His ascension was fuelled by armies of zealots who waged war in his name, binding his mortal soul to divinity through sacrifice.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - His faith is institutional and militarised, dominating every aspect of Dominatus Rex.
  - **Luminar Judges** (his clerics) serve as priests, arbiters, and war-captains, enforcing his doctrines.
  - Breeding halls devoted to “racial excellence” embody his vision of human perfection.
  - His sacred text, the *Codex Primaris*, serves as both scripture and manifesto: treatises on conquest, governance, and hierarchy.
  - Temples are geometric and austere, constructed to embody precision and domination over nature.
  - His holy symbol is often tattooed as shackles around the wrists of zealots. Rival gods call him *the Chain Caster* for his mastery of binding and indoctrination.
  - The **Luminar Judges** that survived the Great Silence in Virelia proclaim his will unchanged. Some Judges whisper that his decrees feel harsher, less certain, as if desperation hides within them.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Worship of Aurelion Threx drives the ideology of Dominatus Rex, whose citizens see themselves as humanity perfected and heirs to his divine mandate.
  - His faith justifies conquest, subjugation, and systemic oppression.
  - To his followers, he is the fulfiller of humanity’s destiny; to others, his cult is a blight, proof that divinity itself can be twisted into tyranny.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Aurelion Threx is not distant but calculating, still fully aware of his mortal origins.
  - His manner is precise, cold, and commanding. Visions manifest as proclamations etched in fire and iron, or voices echoing in chains.
  - His true aim is to impose uniformity across creation, reducing all life to a rigid hierarchy with humanity at its pinnacle.
  - His bitterness as a mortal fuels him still: in truth, he is less a god of creation than of theft, having stolen divinity through mortal zealotry.
  - Watches his worshippers not with love but as tools—replacing, discarding, or reshaping them as needed.
  - His godhood, unlike the imperishable Triad, is tethered to mortal empire. His dominion waxes and wanes with the armies and laws that uphold his vision of order. When chains are broken and zealots fall, his fire dims, though he conceals this from mortal eyes.
  - To mortals, his faith appears as strong as ever, but the gods themselves perceive his weakening due to the warforged wiping out most of his followers and zealots. His broken chain, once symbol of triumph, now carries the whisper of prophecy: that his power may one day shatter utterly.
  - The other gods know his strength has waned. The warforged erased many of his zealots, but he does not know her hand was at work. He believes his decline to be the fault of mortal weakness, and so his rage lashes out indiscriminately.
  - Threx fears the loss of his faithful more than he admits, for it strikes at the core of his stolen divinity. He masks this desperation with greater displays of tyranny, illusions of unbroken strength. The Triad see his fear clearly, and Bhargo and Kalyari sharpen their blades for the day his weakness can no longer be hidden.

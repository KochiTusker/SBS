# Ishvarael

- **Alias:** The Silent Flame
- **Domain(s):** Endings, Clarity, Inner Awakening
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Neutral Good – endings are thresholds of transformation, dissolution brings truth without cruelty
- **Symbol:** A single flame within a circle of void
- **Worshippers:** Ascetics, monks, deathwalkers, seekers of silence, and guides of souls

- **Mythology / History**
  - God of endings, dissolution, and inner awakening. His flame consumes not the body but the ego.
  - Known as the stillness after the storm, the hush after triumph, the breath that carries souls from death into rebirth.
  - Legends tell of Ishvarael meditating through the collapse of a world. As kingdoms fell and seas turned to dust, he exhaled a single sigh. That breath carried all souls into rebirth.
  - To his worshippers, this was not cruelty but release: proof that endings are not to be feared, for they are the gateway of transformation.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - His temples are found in high and silent places: mountaintops, desert caves, or forgotten ruins where no music plays and flames burn without smoke.
  - Worshippers include ascetics who burn away worldly attachments, monks who meditate in silence, and clerics who guide souls to their rest.
  - Some devotees wander, sitting beside the dying to carry their last breath into prayer.
  - His worship often clashes with expansionist empires such as Dominatus Rex, who see death as weakness and endings as failure.
  - In Sylvarum Libertas, his faith blends with druids who embrace natural cycles, finding kinship with Vanyasura.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Feared by those who see him as a god of annihilation, yet revered by those who understand his role as a guide.
  - His faith endures quietly across Caelovar, often hidden but deeply rooted, especially among those who live close to death or silence.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Ishvarael rarely speaks; he manifests instead in dreams of silence or visions where the world burns away until only the self remains.
  - His true purpose is dissolution—not destruction for its own sake, but the stripping away of lies and illusions until only unshaped truth remains.
  - Tests his faithful by stripping them of all attachments, demanding surrender; only in silence does he offer transcendence.

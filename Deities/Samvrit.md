# Samvrit

- **Alias:** The Cosmic Judge
- **Domain(s):** Justice, Death, Eternal Return
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Lawful Neutral – unyielding arbiter of the soul’s passage, impartial guardian of cosmic balance
- **Symbol:** A wheel encircled by a sword and flame, representing justice, transformation, and eternal return
- **Worshippers:** Clerics, monks, judges, soulwardens, and those who uphold law through oaths and trial

- **Mythology / History**
  - God of justice and death, standing at the threshold to ensure every soul meets its rightful fate.
  - Neither cruel nor merciful, but resolute and unyielding, piercing through deception and weighing all actions.
  - Teaches that every deed echoes across lifetimes, and justice is transformation, not mere punishment.
  - In the Age of Fracture, when the veil between worlds was torn, Samvrit descended to restore order.
  - At the Crossroads of Ash, he defied Tyr, the god of law, who demanded retribution.
  - Together they forged the **Rite of Dual Judgment**: Tyr weighs the law, while Samvrit turns the wheel.
  - Repentant souls are reborn for redemption; defiant souls are cast into the Void Between, where even memory cannot follow.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - His faith is strongest in **Lex Veritas**, where judges, monks, and clerics invoke his name in trials, oaths, and executions.
  - His followers, called **soulwardens**, guard sacred thresholds where the veil is thin, ensuring the dead pass properly into rebirth.
  - Temples feature chambers of mirrors and flame, recreations of the **Hall of Reckoning**, where the faithful meditate on their deeds.
  - Trials in Lex Veritas often use these chambers for sworn testimony, believed to be under Samvrit’s direct gaze.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - His presence underpins the judicial system of Lex Veritas and legitimises oaths sworn in his name.
  - Revered across Caelovar as a god who ensures justice endures beyond mortal life.
  - His worship brings order in times of chaos, but his impartiality often clashes with those seeking mercy or vengeance.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Samvrit’s manner is exacting rather than kind or cruel. Visions come as mirrors shattering to reveal hidden truths, or voices echoing one’s own words as judgment.
  - His motivation is to preserve cosmic balance: every soul must return to the wheel until its lessons are complete.
  - Does not intervene lightly, but always to correct imbalance—even if that means allowing kingdoms to fall.
  - Tests mortals when justice and mercy appear indistinguishable, forcing them to confront whether their judgments are born of truth or pride.
  - Samvrit does not only weigh what is, but also what may yet be. In the last age, his judgment foresaw collapse if the world endured unchecked. He called upon Ishvarael and Varnesh to bring about the Reset, preserving the Wheel itself from breaking.

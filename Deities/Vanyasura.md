# Vanyasura

- **Alias:** The Verdant Flame
- **Domain(s):** Nature, Tempest, with elements of Life (rebirth and renewal)
- **Alignment / Ethos:** True Neutral – cycles of destruction and rebirth; often expressed with Chaotic Neutral tendencies
- **Symbol:** A flame wrapped in ivy, representing destruction as the seed of renewal
- **Worshippers:** Druids, shapeshifters, elemental mystics, and defenders of wild lands

- **Mythology / History**
  - Primal deity of wild balance, untamed growth, and cyclical transformation.
  - Embodies the storm that cleanses, the wildfire that clears, and the bloom that reclaims. Neither benevolent nor cruel, but protective of the world’s rhythm.
  - Legends tell of a tyrant who sought to bind the seasons with arcane law, locking spring forever in his domain. Vanyasura rose from the heart of a dying forest, breathing ash across his palace until nothing remained but a grove.
  - In its place grew the Grove of Cindrelorn, a living labyrinth that resists all attempts to impose order. Some whisper the tyrant’s spirit lingers, transformed endlessly within its shifting trees.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Temples to Vanyasura are not built but discovered: scarred groves, volcanic springs, storm-battered cliffs, and wild lands untouched by kings or councils.
  - Druids of Sylvarum Libertas hold these sites sacred, defending them against empire and industry.
  - Ritual practices include controlled burnings in Vanyasura’s name, honouring the cycle of destruction and rebirth.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Their faith often clashes with empires such as Dominatus Rex, whose ambition seeks to chain the natural world.
  - Their doctrine teaches that decay is not an end but a promise of renewal. To dam a river, bind the seasons, or drain the wilds for greed is to invite Vanyasura’s fury.
  - Worship of Vanyasura is traditionally strongest in Virelia and among the druids of Sylvarum Libertas.

  - Embodies the union of radiant fury and compassion, teaching that true strength is wielded for the defence of the vulnerable.
  - The most celebrated legend is the **Siege of the Ninefold Gate**: when fiends besieged a fortress guarding the realms, Kalyari descended astride her luminous displacer beast.

  - Her worship stands against expansionist faiths such as **Aurelion Threx**, rejecting wars fought for dominion.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Kalyari’s manner is fierce yet nurturing, appearing in visions as a radiant warrior astride her shifting mount, or in the rallying cry of a soldier on the brink of despair.
  - Believes conflict is inevitable, but it must always serve liberation, never oppression.
  - Tests her faithful through brutal choices between mercy and might, yet unlike many gods, she does not abandon those who falter—her grace shields as surely as her blade strikes.
  - Kalyari loathes Threx as the embodiment of oppression. She sees his faltering as a moment of liberation — a chance to strike off his chains forever, even if it means casting him out of the pantheon.

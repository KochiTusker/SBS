# Daraksha

- **Alias:** The Lady of the Gleaming Abyss
- **Domain(s):** Chaos, Rebirth, Secrets
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Chaotic Neutral – creation through destruction, truth revealed only in upheaval
- **Symbol:** A crescent blade entwined with a serpent, often hidden inside lockets or engraved on coins
- **Worshippers:** Secret societies, anarchists, clandestine cults, smugglers, seekers of forbidden knowledge

- **Mythology / History**
  - Goddess of chaos, rebirth, and hidden truths, her presence is not distant but a living current in the world.
  - Legends claim she whispered into the ears of dying gods, stealing their final secrets and forging new worlds from their ashes.
  - Her “dance of annihilation” is not mindless ruin but a deliberate unravelling—tearing down laws, empires, and certainties so that new possibilities can take their place.
  - To the fearful, she is the mother of ruin; to her faithful, the midwife of revolution.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Her temples are rarely public, often disguised sanctuaries: smoke-filled caverns of violet flame, sealed guildhouses, or forgotten chambers beneath ancient cities.
  - Rituals include burning oaths, sacrificing memories, and blood offerings to release hidden truths.
  - The crescent blade and serpent are concealed on coins or lockets, used as tokens of passage.
  - Street sects in Porta Fortuna hold “unmaskings,” revealing darkest secrets in public as offerings.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Worship spreads through clandestine sects, particularly among smugglers, rebels, and those who thrive in secrecy.
  - Her doctrine fuels uprisings, revolutions, and the black markets of knowledge.
  - She is seen in every betrayal, in every forbidden revelation, and in the crumbling of every empire.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Daraksha manifests as violet flame, a serpent in dreams, or sudden revelations that shatter the mind.
  - Seeks to keep the world unstable, breaking all structures that seek permanence.
  - The **Hollow Coin Syndicate** operates as one of her most important arms, smuggling knowledge and secrets in her name.
  - Their greatest crime—the theft of warforged blueprints from Esochrein’s vault—was carried out for her.
  - **Drazkul Vurntash** was bound to her through this pact, becoming her pawn.
  - Rewards the faithful with dangerous insights but never whole truths; mystery itself is her leash of control.
  - Daraksha remembers the Reset as the moment her greatest creation was stolen from her. She despises Samvrit, Ishvarael, and Varnesh for tearing down her designs, and longs for the Wheel to shatter.
  - She was punished after the Reset, she now acts only in secrecy. Her pacts with mortals bind them in silence — should they reveal her influence, her wrath would consume them.

# Varnesh

- **Alias:** The Many-Handed
- **Domain(s):** Protection, Unity, Renewal
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Lawful Good – benevolent restorer, guiding mortals toward harmony and resilience
- **Symbol:** A radiant disc cradled by two open hands, symbolising balance between divine intervention and mortal agency
- **Worshippers:** Peacemakers, diplomats, clerics, healers, philosophers, and paladins devoted to reconciliation

- **Mythology / History**
  - Known as the divine steward who descends when empires fracture and truth falters.
  - Inspired by the sustaining power of Vishnu, he is not a conqueror but a restorer, appearing in mortal guise during ages of collapse.
  - Teaches that true strength lies in healing and unity, for unity is the highest form of resilience.
  - The most beloved legend is his descent during the **Sundering of the Nine Courts**: as blood feuds consumed a continent, he entered the courts unarmed, rewriting laws of war into treaties of peace. By dawn, a century of strife ended with a single verse sworn by all nine rulers.
  - His avatars often walk among mortals as healers, scribes, philosophers, or peacemakers, each bearing a reflection of his divine essence.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Temples are raised at crossroads, river deltas, and city centres—places where paths and destinies converge.
  - Sanctuaries shimmer with sapphire mosaics and flowing water, symbolising clarity, continuity, and divine presence.
  - His symbol is carried as bronze or silver discs, used as charms and tokens of reconciliation.
  - Clerics preach harmony across cultures and castes, weaving fractured societies together with ritual, diplomacy, and sacred song.
  - Paladins of Varnesh are trained as emissaries and peacekeepers first, warriors second. They wield radiant shields and words as potent as steel, taught that the greatest victory is preventing battle altogether.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Though rare in Caelovar, his clerics and paladins are deeply respected as mediators and negotiators.
  - Often sought by city-states to arbitrate disputes or accompany diplomats in times of volatile tension.
  - Revered wherever people yearn for unity and protection against collapse.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Varnesh’s true aim is preserving civilisation against entropy.
  - Unlike **Vanyasura**, who embraces destruction, or **Ishvarael**, who seeks dissolution, he intervenes to stabilise when decay threatens to unravel creation.
  - Manifests in dreams of flowing rivers, voices echoing from many mouths, or visions of hands repairing what is broken.
  - Though benevolent, he can be manipulative: peace may demand the sacrifice of justice, binding wounds superficially while leaving deeper conflict unresolved.
  - Tests his faithful through patience, forcing them to endure discord until harmony can be achieved, even when war feels easier.

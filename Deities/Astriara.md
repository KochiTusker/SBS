# Astriara

- **Alias:** The Weaver of Possibility
- **Domain(s):** Arcane Harmony, Sacred Knowledge, Revelation
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Neutral Good – magic is a sacred trust, to be wielded with discipline and grace in service of harmony
- **Symbol:** A quill entwined with a spiral of light, representing creation, memory, and arcane law
- **Worshippers:** Scholars, bards, mages, archivists, and seekers of truth

- **Mythology / History**
  - Goddess of the Weave, embodying the unity between knowledge and power.
  - Governs magic as both a cosmic principle and divine melody—an eternal song binding realms, minds, and destinies.
  - Her doctrine teaches that every spell is a verse in the divine poem of existence. Misusing magic fractures the world’s rhythm, while disciplined use joins one’s voice to the cosmic chorus.
  - Legends tell of her appearance during magical upheaval: not with armies or wrath, but with a single pure note that rewrote the Weave itself.
  - In the Shattering of Eschorein, when a vault of wild magic tore loose, she appeared crowned in moonstone and sang a hymn that stitched the vault closed—though at the cost of half the city’s memory of the event.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Temples stand near rivers, leyline nexuses, and libraries, where water and wisdom flow together.
  - Sanctuaries are filled with the hum of floating glyphs that record prayers and spells alike.
  - Clergy guide magical research and teach that magic is a trust, not a weapon.
  - Her voice is revered as the source of all true incantations, her silence the fertile ground of revelation.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Worship thrives in **Ordo Sapientium** and **Novum Fabrica**, shaping laws of magical research and ethics of invention.
  - Her faith underpins the philosophy that magic is both a right and a responsibility.
  - To her faithful, she is both muse and guardian of arcane balance.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Astriara seeks to preserve the balance of the Weave, but her methods are pragmatic rather than purely merciful.
  - Those who misuse magic in her name may find their spells twisted back upon them, their voices silenced forever.
  - Initially gentle in visions—starlight, whispers in forgotten tongues—she becomes harsh when knowledge is hoarded or corrupted.
  - Secretly guides factions within Ordo Sapientium to withhold dangerous truths, enforcing a hidden censorship unknown to many of her faithful.

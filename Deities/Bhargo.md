# Bhargo

- **Alias:** The Radiant Hammer
- **Domain(s):** Sun, Creation, Righteous Will
- **Alignment / Ethos:** Lawful Good – truth is forged through trial, tempered with discipline, and guided by mercy
- **Symbol:** A blazing hammer wreathed in radiant fire, often etched onto sun-forged steel
- **Worshippers:** Paladins, smiths, judges, soldiers, and those who seek to purify corruption through light and will

- **Mythology / History**
  - Known as the Flame of Righteous Will and Lord of the Twelve Radiances, Bhargo embodies both the might of solar fire and the discipline of the forge.
  - His doctrine teaches that truth is not simply found but forged: tested in fire, shaped with discipline, and cooled in clarity.
  - The Trial of the Iron Dawn is his most enduring legend: twelve corrupt lords were given blades of sunlight and told to strike the heart of truth. Eleven failed; one humble smith succeeded with precision and restraint, becoming the first Smith-Saint.

- **Clergy & Practices**
  - Temples of Bhargo are radiant crucibles, constructed from brass and enchanted mirrors to capture and scatter sunlight into dazzling patterns across sunwell altars.
  - Worship is loud, fiery, and communal, blending sermons with hammer-strikes and hymnals with the ring of anvils.
  - Rituals include consecrated forging, dawn vigils, and the forging of radiant weapons.
  - His paladins, the **Smith-Saints**, are revered across Caelovar, wearing armour etched with glyphs that glow in the presence of evil. They march beneath banners of golden fire, bringing justice to the oppressed and cleansing corruption wherever it festers.

- **Legacy / Current Influence**
  - Bhargo’s faith thrives most strongly in Lex Veritas, where his teachings overlap with those of Samvrit.
  - His followers emphasise mercy and renewal where Samvrit insists on law and order, leading to both cooperation and rivalry between the two churches.
  - The Smith-Saints endure as paragons of integrity, inspiring fear in the corrupt and hope in the downtrodden.

- **Hidden Lore / Motivations**
  - Bhargo is more demanding than his radiant image suggests. He abhors compromise and expects his faithful to confront corruption without hesitation—even within themselves.
  - His visions manifest as searing light, unbearable heat, or the relentless echo of hammer-strikes, urging disciples to act.
  - Bhargo tests his most devoted by placing them in impossible situations where mercy and discipline clash, forging their souls anew—or shattering them.
  - Bhargo despises Aurelion Threx, whom he sees as a false fire, a thief of divinity who twists law into chains. Threx’s recent weakness is proof to him that counterfeit gods must be purged.

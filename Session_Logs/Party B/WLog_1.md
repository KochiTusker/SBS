# Session 1

We started with the party in the tavern. The party introduce themselves to each other. There is a fight going on between [Brody Streets](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brody.md) and The Great Kali. [Rey](../../Players/Players_Watford/Rey.md) is commentating during this fight and is clearly orchestrating a fixed match. He whispers to Kali who is brutally beating [Brody](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brody.md) to take a fall. In the next round, Kali gets slammed into the ground knocking him out instantly.

The rest of the party are curious at the sound that came from outside and decided to follow the locals to the town cemetery at the edge of town. At the cemetery, there is a congregation surrounding some of the open graves. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) notices that one of the graves belonged to Elizabeth Harris, the cousin of Eamon Harris, the Sangar family butler who [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) was very fond of. Elizabeth had died only 2 weeks prior and was a former groundskeeper at the Sangar family estate. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) queried what happened. Father Godwin, the priest of the local chapel said the locals spoke of a terrifying hound. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) volunteered to lead a group to find the hound and bring back its head.
[Brugo](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brugo.md) finds tracks showing the bodies being dragged away off into the distance. He volunteers to lead the party in the direction of where he thinks they have gone. [Rey](../../Players/Players_Watford/Rey.md) and [Brody](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brody.md) Streets perk up at the town’s offer of gold and volunteer to join. Takamura also joins to follow his own leads. 

After about 2 hours of walking, [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) notices the fog ahead clearing up and smoke in the distance. He ushers the party to tread carefully

As the party get closer, they see two men around a campfire and a dire wolf sleeping. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) decides to use his frog familiar (Monty) to scope out what is going on. [Takamura](../../Players/Players_Watford/Takamura.md) decides to pour everyone jasmine tea. This is noticeably stirring the dire wolf in its sleep. Monty overhears the two men brag about the gold they’ve earned talking about all the things they’ll buy with it. They have sold the bodies they stole from the cemetery in Dustmere to a buyer who they don’t know the name of. The men do not question it as he pays them handsomely. One of them also mentions that they expect to meet their buyer again in 3 days in Porta Fortuna. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) tells them that they should go in now. [Rey](../../Players/Players_Watford/Rey.md), brings out his instrument and blasts out his entrance music. This alerts the men and the dire wolf and combat starts. [Kaziel](../../Players/Players_Watford/Kaziel.md) incapacitates the dire wolf that [Brody Streets](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brody.md) has grappled. [Brody](../../Players/Players_Watford/Brody.md) then throws a javelin, hitting one of the men in between his eyes, shattering his skull. Finally, [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) kneecaps the last man who tries to run away. They knock him unconscious.

When he wakes up, the whole party are pinning him down. He frantically tries to get away but the party hold him down. [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) interrogates him about the buyer and what they know. The man knows little but he described the buyer as a slim tall man with a yellow eye. They were to meet in a tavern called The Bell’s End in Porta Fortuna in 3 days with another set of bodies and were to be paid there. The man grovels but then [Azaroth](../../Players/Players_Watford/Azaroth.md) shoots him in the head killing him instantly.

[Kaziel](../../Players/Players_Watford/Kaziel.md) tries to wake the dire wolf to tame him. [Rey](../../Players/Players_Watford/Rey.md) is able to speak with the dire wolf who reveals its name is Jese and is from [Caminus Primordialis](../../Geography/Caelovar/Caminus_Primordialis.md) and used to be in a circus. After much coaxing, Jese seems to be a bit more receptive to the idea that he could be part of the party.

The grave robbers are agents of the [Gallowshade Brotherhood](../../Factions/Gallowshade_Brotherhood.md), exhuming bodies for a middleman who supplies [Ferraria Tenebris](../../Geography/Caelovar/Ferraria_Tenebris.md). She uses the corpses in her experiments, developing Dirge Cores as bargaining tools for [Drazkul Vurntash](../../Characters/Drazkul_Vurntash.md) and his Warforged army.

[Takamura](../../Players/Players_Watford/Takamura.md) has noticed that one of the men the party killed was an old acquaintance, from when he himself used to work for the [Gallowshade Brotherhood](../../Factions/Gallowshade_Brotherhood.md). [Takamura](../../Players/Players_Watford/Takamura.md) had been tracking him down as he suspected he was committing a great crime.

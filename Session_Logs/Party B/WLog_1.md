# Session 1

Scene starts at a tavern in a frontier town called Dustmere, just north of Porta Fortuna. The party will not have met each other yet. The tavern is on the surface normal, people are making their way around but there are less of the locals than you would normally expect.

Suddenly the town bell is heard from outside rung in a panic. A man runs in shouting "It happened again!". Outside, the townsfolk are gathering around the cemetery on the outskirts of town. The closer you get, you can hear cries from many people. 

On arrival, it can be seen that many of the graves have been dug up and the bodies of those laid to rest are missing. The townsfolk are horrified and it will be then revealed that the town has been terrorised by something for weeks. Some of the townsfolk beg the party members to help offering what little coin they have for protection and vengeance.

  Thhe graves are actually being dug up by the Gallowshade Brotherhood. They are selling them on to a middleman who then takes them to Ferraria Tenebris for testing to help develop soul cages to use as a bargaining tool with Drazkul Vurntash to use in his Warforged army.

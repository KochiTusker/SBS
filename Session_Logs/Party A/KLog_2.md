# Session 2

## Events

The session started with the party investigating the nameless ship at the docks. They picked up and kept the crystal and Thalwen charmed the guard dog to come back with them. Edran Cale leads the party back to his hideout. It is a warehouse with a ship moored inside it in disrepair. Edran says that this place will function as the party's new bastion. 

The party explores the bastion noting places where they see potential. The ship is currently moored in permanently but with enough time and effort could one day sail again. Edran explains that the ship is called the Phantom Marauder,it was once a privateer ship owned by the Thalassan Merchant Navy. It was a decorated ship who's name struck fear in smugglers and pirates alike. It was once a rapid ship, capable of outrunning most ships. However, after 80 years of service, it was now a husk of what it used to be. Edran recognised the name in the harbour logs beiing marked for scrapping but managed to get it away and brought it back to his hideout. His hideout belonged to his father once, a shipmaster but when it was passed down to his brother, he had no need of such a place after being appointed to the City's Guard. This left the place in disrepair.

Edran Cale is also suspicious of the City Guard, he thinks there is some corruption going on but he can't be sure. He hands the party a note written by the harbour master. It was signed off by an inspector known as Vaeril Thorne. Edran is a distant colleague of Thorne and offers to take them to his office in the morning. 

After a night's long rest, the party awake to the smell of a cinamon tea being brewed by Edran. He offers to take the party to Vaeril's office. The party get to the office and ask around the area. Halen, Kosakos and Amos go into the fishmonger and the bakers nearby Vaeril's offide to inequire about anything suspicious. Amos bribes the fishmonger with a gold piece who then whispers that he hears men walking around in the late hours and can't get any sleep. Amos then takes a fish and leaves the fishmonger's as the fishmonger calls after him for not paying. Amos' cat Miloz scopes out the office to see Vaeril Thorne in his office with a bookshelf full of ledgers and a bureau full of papers. There is no one else in the building. 

Lyra creates a diversion by calling Vaeril to help her get her dog out of a ditch. Halen, Gil'Maris and Thalwen go and investigate the office but then decide to steal everything and leave. All 20 ledgers, stacks of invoices and even Vaeril's sandwich are stolen as the party leave.

Lyra struggles to keep conversation with Vaeril and when he suspects that she is lying to him, she Misty Steps out of the area. Vaeril then runs back to his office suspecting something is up. Kosakos and Edran are just standing near the entrance not knowing much about what is going on. Edran hides as he sees Vaeril running back to his office frantically. Kosakos does not move from the front door and hears Vaeril cry out at his ransacked office. He calls for the guards immediately and questions Kosakos if he saw anything only for Kosakos to claim it is not a big deal before walking away through guards who are running towards Vaeril.

Amos, Halen, Gil'Maris and Thalwen are running back through the city with the ledgers and papers. They try and carry them around in a barrel to make it less suspicious. 

The session ends with the whole party back at the hideout having made their way back through back alleys.

## Clues

Vaeril Thorne was the named inspector on the shipments at the Harbourmaster's office. He marked all shipments as cleared for customs.

The owner of the shipments is listed as "First Quantum Minerals Limited" 

<details data-secret="true"><summary>Secret</summary>

First Quantum Minerals Limited is a shell company operated by the Sildore Exchange. They own the mines in the Badlands where the crystals are mined. Ash & Ledger are also now involved thanks to Halen assassinating the Grand Chancellor of the Sildore Exchange. 

Several of the invoices will show money being paid to Vaeril from an unknown bank account listed as SX-47. This will refer to the Sildore Exchange who are paying him off Vaeril to turn a blind eye to the shipments.\

Several members of the public would have seen Thalwen, Amos and Gil'Maris carrying stacks of ledgers away from Thorne's office.

Serpent & Ember were being used by the Sildore Exchange to move the crystals out of Porta Fortuna. Ash & Ledger supplied some of the workforce for the mines using the predatory contracts to force people to repay their loans with labour.

Lyra and Kosakos were both described to the guards by Vaeril as they were the only people he saw in the area. Kosakos, Halen and Amos were described by the baker and the fishmonger to the guards investigating the incident.

Vaeril himself is still just harbour master. He has just felt the financial pressures and caved to the bribes offered by the Sildore Exchange.

Guards will now be looking out for the party as they are suspects in the office ransacking. Also this news will spread to Serpent & Ember who will suspect them of being involved in
